<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is not one of you, my dear boys and girls,
who does not know this oft-sung missionary hymn.
But if there is, then of this I am sure, there is not
one who knows it who does not love it, for it is one
of the most beautiful of all our hymns. Since it was
written many years ago by Bishop Heber, hundreds
and hundreds of young voices have sung it; hundreds
and hundreds are singing it to-day; and hundreds
and hundreds will yet sing it.</p>

<p>It is a great call to us who know Christ our Saviour
to spread abroad into all heathen lands our knowledge
of Him who came down from heaven and
died to save mankind. And nobly has the call been
responded to. The Christian Churches have sent
forth messengers into all the ends of the earth to
preach the &#8220;glad tidings of great joy which shall be
to all people&#8221; in obedience to the command of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
risen Lord who said, &#8220;Go ye, therefore, and teach
all nations.&#8221;</p>

<p>So in our own day we find that Christ&#8217;s ambassadors
have gone into every continent and penetrated into
the most distant lands; that the Bible, or some
part of it at least, has been translated into many
different languages; and that the lives of countless
numbers of native peoples have been made purer
and holier and happier by their knowledge of Him who
loves them.</p>

<p>As you all know one of the continents of the earth
is called Africa&mdash;the dark Continent; and it is about
Africa and its children I want to write to you.</p>

<small>THE DARK CONTINENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Africa</span> has been called the Dark Continent, and the
name is suitable in more ways than one. To the
European people it was for ages a dark continent,
because it was unknown, that is, unexplored by
them. The name is also appropriate because Africa
is the home of millions of dark-skinned people. But
from a Christian point of view Africa is the dark
continent, because over most of its inhabitants there
still hangs a black cloud of heathen darkness that shuts
out the glorious rays of the Gospel of Light and Love.</p>

<p>Of course you must know that Africa has not all
been an unknown land. The northern part of it,
which borders the Mediterranean Sea, has been known
from ancient times. And is not Egypt the land of
the Nile and the home of the Pharaohs in Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
although we sometimes do not realise it? But it is
not so much of these northern lands that I want to
tell you as about the far greater portion that stretches
away south over the Equator right down to the Cape.
This part was until not so long ago the dark unknown
continent, the land of those teeming millions of dark-skinned
people who lived out their lives without ever
hearing the Gospel story and without knowing the
love of God for the children of men.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years very, very little was known
of this vast land lying away to the south. The
ancient peoples must have been afraid to explore it,
and it is no wonder, for Africa is a land full of dangers
and difficulties that must have appeared overwhelming
to the ancients. Here is a description of part of
a voyage along the African Coast made in the old
days. I read it the other day in a nice book about
Central Africa. &#8220;Having taken in water we sailed
thence straight forwards until we came to a great
gulf which the interpreter said was called the Horn
of the West. In it was a large island, and in the island
a lake like a sea, and in this another island on which
we landed; and by day we saw nothing but woods,
but by night we saw many fires burning, and heard
the sounds of flutes and cymbals, and the beating
of drums, and an immense shouting. Fear came
upon us, and the soothsayers bade us quit the island.
Having speedily set sail, we passed by a burning
country full of incense, and from it huge streams of
fire flowed into the sea; and the land could not be
walked upon because of the heat. Being alarmed
we speedily sailed away thence also, and going along
four days we saw by night the land full of flame,
and in the midst was a lofty fire, greater than the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and seeming to touch the stars. This by day appeared
as a vast mountain called the Chariot of the Gods.
On the third day from this, sailing by fiery streams,
we came to a gulf called the Horn of the South.&#8221;</p>

<p>After reading such a description do you wonder
that the ancients left the land to the south severely
alone? We to-day can give a very simple explanation
for the above fiery exhibition. These ancient mariners
had evidently visited that part of Africa at the time
of the bush fires and were consequently appalled.</p>

<p>In the year 1486 a Portuguese navigator, called
Diaz, sighted the Cape of Good Hope; and a fellow
countryman, Vasco da Gama, a few years later, discovered
Natal and the Cape route to India. But of
inland exploration there was little or none till men
like James Bruce and Mungo Park made their famous
journeys in the interior, the one on the Blue Nile, and
the other on the Niger. Then bit by bit our knowledge
of the interior of Africa was added to by such brave
men of whom Dr Livingstone is the most famous.</p>

<p>If you ever get the opportunity of looking at an
old map of Africa you will find that most of the
interior is blank. But now the map of Africa is
filled with names and features that are known to us
through exploration. Mighty rivers and great lakes
have been discovered, and mountains of which the
ancients only dreamed are familiar to us. All honour
to the brave men who have laid us so heavily under
their debt, and to no one more than to David Livingstone,
whose noble example was as an inspiration,
and who as missionary and explorer laid down his
life for the Dark Continent.</p>

<p>But for many years the European nations only
looked upon Africa as a land whence slaves were to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
be taken for their plantations in the New World.
And this part of the history of Africa is a dark blot
upon their fair fame. What with the European
slave-buying in the West, the Arab slave-hunting in
the East, and the chiefs perpetually at war and
enslaving one another&#8217;s people, the lives of countless
numbers of these ignorant people were made miserable
in the extreme.</p>

<p>The village lies slumbering peacefully in the hollow
in the midst of its gardens of maize and sweet potatoes.
It is silently surrounded before dawn by the cruel
Arab and his men. Shots ring out. The startled
inhabitants rush forth into the grey morning with
shouts of &#8220;Nkondo!&#8221; (&#8220;War!&#8221;) &#8220;Nkondo!&#8221; (&#8220;War!&#8221;)
The men who resist or try to flee are ruthlessly shot
down. Houses and gardens are burned and destroyed,
the dead and dying are left where they
fall, round the necks of the living is riveted the
hateful slave stick, and the gang is on its way to
the coast leaving behind only the abomination of
desolation. Too often, alas! have the children of
Africa tasted of this bitter cup.</p>

<p>And now that the European people know the sin
from which they were freed by the mercy of God,
it behoves them to try their best to make up to the
black people for the injury they formerly did them.
That much is being done we know for the whole
continent is marked out as belonging to the different
European nations and is ruled by them. So the days
of the old tribal wars are over and the slave-hunter
has disappeared from the land.</p>

<p>The future of the Dark Continent you will then
see lies now to a large extent in the hands of the people
of Europe. The old rule of the native chiefs has in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
most places passed away, and in others is rapidly
passing. The power has gone into the hands of the
white man. Pray God he may use it wisely and guide
his black brother towards the green pastures as
becomes a follower of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus
Christ.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>THE GREAT RACES OF AFRICA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I begin to speak to you about the children
of Africa, I would like you to understand how the
people of Africa are separated into different families
or divisions. There are in Africa nearly two hundred
millions of people, but they do not all belong to
the same race. The three big families are the Berbers
in the north, the Negroes in the middle, and the Bantus
in the south. Besides these there are some smaller
divisions to which belong the Pigmies or Dwarfs,
those strange little people whom Stanley encountered
on his famous journey through the terrible forests
of the Congo. Then there are the Hottentots and the
Bushmen of the south-west corner of Africa, who
have been driven into the desert and hilly places by
the more powerful invading Bantu tribes.</p>

<p>Many long years ago the whole of the northern
part of Africa was invaded by large numbers of fierce
Arab tribes. They were very warlike and soon
overran the whole country and settled down in it,
and lived side by side with the original people of the
country as their masters, but with whom they afterwards
mingled. So the North Africans of to-day are,
you see, a people of mixed race.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>These hordes of conquering Arabs who overran the
country were Mohammedans, and they forced their
religion upon the people among whom they settled.
Mohammedanism is therefore the chief religion of
the north of Africa. Now these Berber tribes are
very dark-skinned when compared with Europeans,
but they do not belong to the black people. They
are, in fact, classed along with the white races.</p>

<p>The true black people are the Negroes, and their
home is in the middle part of Africa which stretches
eastwards right across from the West Coast. They
are the people with the black skins, the woolly heads,
the thick lips, the flat noses, and the beautiful white
teeth. It is they whose forefathers were bought
as slaves and taken to America where we find their
descendants to-day. They were a heathen people,
and had many cruel customs, and some of them were
cannibals. Mohammedanism has come upon them
from the north and the east, and a great many of
them now belong to that religion.</p>

<p>The home of the Bantu people is the great southern
portion of Africa. The Bantus are not so black as
are the Negroes, nor are they quite so thick-lipped
and flat-nosed. But in all other ways they are very
similar to their Negro neighbours. They are a heathen
people although Christianity has made good progress
among them. They are brave and intelligent, and
are showing themselves able to adopt a higher and
better way of living.</p>

<p>The other smaller tribes, the Pigmies, the Hottentots,
and the Bushmen are far below the Negroes and
Bantus in intelligence. The first of these, the Pigmies
or Dwarfs, inhabit the dense forest region of the Congo,
and not very much is known about them even to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
The Hottentots and the Bushmen live away down
in the extreme south-west of Africa and the Kalahari
Desert. It is said that they are the descendants of
the older inhabitants of Africa, who had to seek refuge
in the hills and deserts from the powerful Bantu
tribes who invaded and seized their country.</p>

<p>Now I think this will be quite enough information
about the different races dwelling in Africa. What
I want you to understand is that the whole of the
northern portion of Africa is Mohammedan, that the
Negro people are many already Mohammedan, and
that others are rapidly being converted to that religion,
and that the Bantu people are mostly yet
heathen, while some have become Christian, especially
those of the south.</p>

<p>In Africa there is a great war going on. Three
mighty forces or powers are fighting against one
another, and victory cannot go to them all. These
great forces are Mohammedanism, heathenism, and
Christianity. But to those of us who know the
African, it is plain that the great fight will be between
the first and the last, that the Africans will be ruled by
the Cross or the Crescent, that the Bible or the
Koran will be their Holy Book, that Mohammed or
Christ will be their guide in this life.</p>

<p>Already we see that the whole of the north follows
the Prophet of Mecca. The nature-worship of the
Negro and Bantu, although yet strong, will pass away
with the passing years. The south is largely Christian,
and Christianity is pushing up northwards. Christian
missions are attacking the strongholds of Mohammedanism
and heathenism in the north, west, and east,
in Egypt and the newly opened Soudan.</p>

want to know about them now, the little sons and
daughters of the big black people I have so far written
about.</p>

<p>Well, it so happens that I am sitting writing this
story in a native hut in Africa, many thousands of
miles away from you; and if any of you wanted to
come and join me here and see for yourselves, you
would have to travel a good many weeks to reach me.
Will you let me first try to describe this house I am
in, and the village of which it is part, as being what
most African huts and villages are like, and in which
black boys and girls are born and play.</p>

<p>This hut is a square one, and a good deal larger
than you would imagine. It is the size of a small
cottage at home. Long ago most of the huts were
round, I believe, and indeed many of them are so yet.
But square ones have come into fashion here, for even
in far-off Africa there is such a thing as fashion, and
it can change too. This hut is divided into three
rooms. The middle one is provided with a door to
the front and another to the back. The rooms on each
side have very small windows like spy holes looking
out to each end. All round the house runs a verandah
which prevents the fierce rays of the sun from beating
against the walls of the house and throws off the
heavy showers of rain of the wet season clear of the
house. The whole house is built of grass and bamboos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
and is smeared over with mud inside and out. The
roof, supported by stout cross beams in the middle
of the partition walls in which other forked beams
stand, slopes not very steeply down to the verandah
posts which hold up its lower edges. It is heavily
thatched with fine long grass. The owner knows
by experience what a tropical thunder-shower means,
so he leaves nothing to chance in thatching his
house.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor in the room with the doors
a small hole has been scooped. It is surrounded with
stones and forms the cooking hearth, although there
is also attached to this house a very small grass shed
about a dozen yards away at the back of the house,
which is used as a kitchen on most occasions. The
doors are made of grass and bamboos, and at night
are put in place and held firm by a wooden cross
bar. Such is the house of a well-off native of Africa.
It takes but a few weeks to build and lasts but
a few years.</p>

<p>Of course in a house with such small windows it is
always more or less dark. In the end rooms with
the spy holes it is always dark to me. But black
boys and girls do not seem to mind this. In fact
I believe they are like owls and cats, and can see
in the dark. I am certain though of this that
they can see ever so much better than white
children can.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A VILLAGE HUT</p>

<p>There is not much to look at in the way of furniture
in a black man&#8217;s house. Here is a table made in
imitation of a European one and some chairs too,
whose backs look forbiddingly straight, a few cooking
pots, some sleeping mats, a hoe or two, some baskets,
and some odds and ends complete the list. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
surprises a white man is the number of things the
black people can do without. For instance, if a
white man wants to travel in this country, he must
first of all gather together a crowd of natives to carry
him and his belongings. He must have a tent and
a bed, pots and pans, boxes of provisions, a cook,
and servants, before he can travel in comfort. But
if a black man goes on a journey he simply takes a
pot and some food with him, and maybe a mat and
blanket, takes his stick in his hand and his bundle
on his shoulder and off he goes, it may be to walk
hundreds of miles before he comes to his destination.</p>

<p>To-day there is no fire in the hearth. There is
no chimney in this house so I could not have a fire
and enjoy my stay. The owner, however, would not
mind the smoke from the firewood. He is used to
crouching over a fire and his eyes get hardened. I
see in one corner there is a heap of grain called millet,
and in another a white ant-heap. It has risen in
the night for I did not notice it before, and I am glad
that none of my belongings were in that corner of
the room. Nothing but iron seems amiss to the white
ant. His appetite is terrible and he can play sad
havoc with one&#8217;s property in a single night. There
is grain in one corner I have said, and consequently
there are rats.</p>

<p>The Pied Piper of Hamlin of whom you have all
heard would find plenty of rats to charm in any
African village. Then in the houses there are many
kinds of biting insects, and some that don&#8217;t bite, but
look ugly. The mosquito is calling ping! ping!
everywhere, and night is made endurable only by
retiring under a mosquito net. The mosquito is
the most dangerous insect in Africa, for it has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
found out by clever doctors that it is the mosquito
bite that causes the dreaded malaria fever.</p>

<p>In tropical Africa nearly all the insects bite or sting,
even innocent-looking caterpillars, if touched, give
one itch. Nor may you pull every flower you see,
for some of them are more stinging than nettles.
To-day I came across two boys hoeing a road. One
was a bright fellow who kept things lively by singing
snatches of songs and whistling at his work. When
I came near I spied a fine large glossy black beetle
hurrying away after having been thrown up by the
hoe. I asked the lively youth what kind of insect
it was. In reply he dropped his hoe and pounced
upon the unfortunate beetle and held it up to me
for inspection. &#8220;Does it bite?&#8221; I asked, astonished.
&#8220;Oh! yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;look.&#8221; So saying he stuck
the point of one of his fingers close to the head of the
angry creature, which promptly seized it with its
pincers.</p>

<p>But one gets used to these pests, and even the sight
of a spider the size of a two-shilling piece running up
the wall does not disturb one. There is one insect,
however, you may not despise, and which you can never
get accustomed to, the red ant. He comes in millions,
and if he deigns to pay your house a visit while on
his journey, you had better leave him in possession
of the place. Unless you happen to head him off
early with burning grass and red hot ashes you need
not stay to argue with him. Everything living disappears
before him, rats, mice, lizards, cats, dogs,
boys and girls, men and women give way before his
majesty, the red ant.</p>

<p>I remember watching for half an hour an army of
red ants on the march. They were streaming out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
from a small hole in the grass, crossing over a hoed
road, and disappearing into another hole in the grass
on the other side. Each was carrying a tiny load that
looked like a small grain of rice, and was hurrying
after his neighbour as if the whole world depended
on his speed. Here and there on each side of the
hurrying companies were scouts and officers without
loads evidently engaged in keeping the others in order
and in watching for enemies. What I thought were
grains of rice, the boys told me were &#8220;ana a chiswe,&#8221;
that is white ant&#8217;s children. Somewhere underground
there must have been dreadful war and the red ants
were carrying off the spoils of victory.</p>

<p>Next there came along a poor little lizard home
by eager and willing&mdash;I had almost said hands&mdash;pincers.
Here a pair were fixed in, there another
pair. Everywhere that a pair of pincers could find
a grip there was the pair. I pulled the lizard out but
it was quite dead. So I pushed it back into the
excited line and it was soon on the march again.
After a little there came past a curious round little
object into which dozens of ants were sticking and
which with ants swarming atop was being carried
along with the stream. I rescued this strange thing
too, because I was anxious to find out what it was&mdash;the
thing inside this living ball of ants. One of the
boys got a basin of water and plumped the ball into
it, and with a piece of wood scraped the angry insects
and frothy-looking stuff off. Then there was revealed
a tiny toad which the boys called &#8220;Nantuzi.&#8221; It
was just like a little bag with four legs, one at each
corner. When annoyed it swells itself up like a ball
and refuses to budge. When seized by the ants it had
promptly covered itself with a frothy, sticky spittle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and so was little hurt. Had I not rescued it, however,
it would have been eaten at last overcome by numbers.
Then I got tired watching, and left the never-ending
ant army still on the march.</p>

<small>THE AFRICAN CHILD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inside</span> such a house as has been described, and in
many a smaller one, are born the children of Africa.
At first and for a few days they are not black. I am
told they are pink in colour and quite light, but that
they soon darken. The mothers and grandmothers
are very pleased to welcome new babies and bath
and oil them carefully. Nearly all the women one
meets about a village have children tied on their
backs, or are followed by them toddling behind.
These mites glisten in the sun as they are well oiled
to keep their skins in good condition.</p>

<p>In some tribes very little children have no names.
You ask the mother of an infant what she calls her
baby, and she replies, &#8220;Alibe dzina&#8221;&mdash;It has no name.
I once asked the father of a plump little infant what
the name of his child was. He told me that it had
not been named yet but that when the child would
begin to smile and recognise people it would get a
name. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;when he smiles call him
Tommy.&#8221; Months after I saw the child again, a
fine boy he was too, and Tommy was his name. But
alas! Tommy did not live more than two years.
He took some child trouble and died.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HIS FIRST SUIT</p>

<p>Sometimes the father or the mother may give a child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
its name, or sometimes a friend may name it. Many
of the names have no special meaning, but some of
them refer to things that happened or were seen at
the time the child was born. Boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; names
differ from one another although the difference is
not clear to the white man. But if he stays long
enough among the black children he will begin to
know what are boys&#8217; names and what are girls&#8217;.
I know a bright boy who is called &#8220;Mang&#8217;anda.&#8221;
In English you would have to call him Master Playful.
Another child I can recall is called &#8220;Handifuna,&#8221;
which means &#8220;Miss they don&#8217;t want me.&#8221; But
wherever the white man is settling in Africa the
people are picking up European names; and it is a
pity, I think, that the old names will pass away.</p>

<p>Little black children are not nursed and tended
so carefully as white children are. From a very early
age they are tied on to their mother&#8217;s backs and are
taken everywhere. It is seldom that an accident
happens through a child falling out, for the black
children seem to have an extraordinary power of
holding on. If mother is too busy another back is
soon found for baby to show his sticking-on ability.
In any village you may see a group of women pounding
corn in their mortars under a shady tree. It is hard
work, this daily pounding of corn. Up and down
go the heavy wooden pestles. Backwards and forwards
go the heads of the babies tied on the mothers&#8217;
backs. At each downward thud baby&#8217;s neck gets a
violent jerk, but he is all unconscious of it, and sleeps
through an ordeal that would kill his white brother.
Again a woman with an infant on her back may go
a journey of many miles exposed to the full blaze
of the African sun. Yet baby is quite comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and never gives a single cry unless when he is
hungry.</p>

<p>Then black children have no cribs and cradles as
have white ones. When mother is tired of baby,
and there is no other back at hand, she simply lays
him down on a mat and leaves him to himself to do
as he likes. If he makes a noise, well he can just
make it. He will disturb nobody, and is allowed
to cry until he is tired. Unless he is known to be ill,
his squalling, be it never so loud, will attract no attention.
Most of the mothers are very proud of their
children, and oil them and shave their woolly heads
with great care. But in spite of all this care on the
mother&#8217;s part, great numbers of the babies die.
Very often they are really killed through their mother&#8217;s
ignorance of how they ought to be fed and nursed
when sick. Then diseases like smallpox pass through
the villages at intervals and carry off hundreds of
children.</p>

<p>A black infant is not clothed like a white one.
If his mother is very proud of him he will have a
string of beads round his neck or waist. Round his
fat little wrist or neck you will often see tied on by
string a small medicine charm, put there by his fond
mother to protect him against disease or evil influence.
When the babies are big enough to toddle they begin
to look out for themselves, and when they have fairly
found their legs they go everywhere and do almost
anything they like so long as they do not give trouble.</p>

<p>A little boy&#8217;s first article of clothing may be made
of different coloured beads carefully woven into a
square patch, which he wears hanging down before
him from a string of beads encircling his waist. Or it
may perhaps be only the skin of a small animal worn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in the same way as the square of beads. He may,
however, begin with a cloth from the beginning. If
so his mother provides him with a yard of calico,
rolls it round him, and sends him out into the world
as proud as a white boy with his first pair of trousers.</p>

<p>He gets no special food because he is a child. He
eats whatever is going and whatever he can lay his
hands upon. Thus he grows up not unlike a little
animal. There is not much trouble taken with him.
If he lives, he lives; and if he dies&mdash;well, he is buried.
No fond lips have bent over him and kissed him
asleep, for kissing is not known to his people. Nor
has he learned to lisp the name of Jesus at his mother&#8217;s
knee. It is not that his mother does not love him,
for she does in her own peculiar way. But all are
shrouded in ignorance, father, mother and children,
all held in the grip of dark superstitions from which
nothing but the light of the Gospel of Love can free
them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>AN AFRICAN VILLAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> we go round the village now? Well come
away and we&#8217;ll have a walk through it. But as we
are strangers and white, I must warn you that many
pairs of curious eyes will be watching us when we
know not, and all we do and say will be the talk of
the village for a long time to come. It is not every
day that the villagers get such a good look at a white
person, and they will take advantage of their chance
to-day. Babies on backs will cry if we come near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
them, and little mites that can run will disappear
behind their mothers and peep out at us, feeling safe
but very much afraid. In fact, many of the women
frighten their naughty children by telling them that
if they do not behave better they will send them to
the white people, who will eat them. Consequently
when a white man comes along the children often
scatter in terror as from a wild beast. And would
not white children do just the same from a black
man if they were told that he might eat them.</p>

<p>In a certain African Mission not long after school
had been started for the first time, it was found
necessary to build a kiln for the burning of bricks.
But the eyes of the children had been watching the
building, and whatever could it be but a large oven
in which to cook them. So the whole school fled
pell-mell to their homes. Of course you must remember
that in several different parts of Africa some
of the tribes were cannibals, and even in our day
there are still tribes among which the eating of human
flesh is not unknown.</p>

<p>Here we come to a house not unlike the one we have
already described to you, but smaller and not so
neatly finished. The owner will not be so well-off
as the owner of that we occupied. Let us go near
along this path. Here comes an old lady to receive
us, and there go the children round the corner, and
off goes baby yonder into tears, and even the dogs
begin to bark. Banana trees grow all round the
house, and yonder is a small grove of them on the
other side of the courtyard. They are waving a
welcome to us with their large ragged leaves. The
fruit is hanging in bunches here and there on the old
trees, and is evidently not yet ripe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>But before we are introduced to the old lady, who
is coming to meet us, let us take a hasty glance round
about. First we see that the children are getting
braver, and are, beginning to show themselves now.
Ragged looking little things they are, who do not
look overclean. The skin of their bodies is too white
to have been washed recently. Isn&#8217;t it strange that
a black boy when he is dirty looks white; just the
opposite from a white boy, who, when he is dirty,
looks black. The mother of the crying child has
turned round so as to shut us off from baby&#8217;s frightened
gaze. In one corner of the courtyard is a pot on a
fire, the contents of which are boiling briskly. This
we are informed is to be part of the evening meal
which is in preparation. It seems to us but a mass
of green vegetable. Really it consists of juicy green
leaves of a certain kind plucked in the bush. Over
there in the shade of the bananas stand one or two
mortars in which the women pound their grain, and
without which no village, however small, is complete.
On the verandah of the house stands the mill&mdash;a very
primitive one. A large flat stone slightly hollowed
out holds the grain which is ground down by another
stone, a round one, being rubbed backwards and
forwards over the hollow one. Snuff too is ground
from tobacco in this way, for many of the men enjoy
a pinch of snuff and not a few of the women like to
smoke a pipe. A fierce-looking little cat is blinking
up at us, watching us narrowly through the dark
slits in its large yellow-green eyes, seeming in doubt
whether to run off or to put up its back at us. A
sleeping mat, made of split reeds, and spread out on
the ground near the mortars, is covered with maize
ready to be pounded. Two or three baskets are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
lying about, some shallow, some deep, some large,
and some small. That stump of a tree there serves
as a seat when the shade of the bananas is thrown
on it. And down on the whole is pouring a flood of
tropical sunshine, so hot that we are glad to retire
into the shade of a friendly tree.</p>

<p>But the old lady is come and offers us her left hand.
Her arms from the wrist almost to the elbow are
covered with heavy bracelets, and her legs, from the
ankles half way to her knees, are laden with great
heavy anklets of the same metal. Clank! clank!
clank! like a chained prisoner goes the poor old
soul when she walks. Long ago she would carry
these huge ornaments with no difficulty, and not a
little joy. But now, although proud of them still,
no doubt, they must be a trouble to her slipping up
and down on her withered arms and legs, for she has
tried to protect her old ankles by wrapping round
them a rag of calico to keep the brass from hurting.
She is dressed in a single calico, none too new, but, we
are pleased to see, very clean. Other calicoes doubtless
she will possess, carefully stored away and hidden
in a basket in the darkest corner of her house.</p>

<p>Her old face is a mass of wrinkles and she has lost
nearly all her teeth. But her upper lip! What a
sight! Poor old creature, what a huge ring there is
in it. Why, we can see right into her mouth when
she speaks, and to us it is not a pleasant sight. This
ring, seen in many old women, is called here a
&#8220;pelele.&#8221; Men do not wear it. When a girl is
young her upper lip is bored in the middle and a
small piece of bone is put into the hole to keep it
open. Gradually larger and larger pieces are put
in until the full sized &#8220;pelele&#8221; is reached. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
these rings are as much as two inches in size,
and the upper lip is fearfully stretched by wearing
them. It hangs away down over the lower lip, and
the tongue and inside of the mouth are seen when
the old &#8220;pelele&#8221; wearer speaks.</p>

<p>The old dame is very polite but you can see that she
is afraid of us and will be quite glad when we go
elsewhere. She says her cat is not a bit fierce but
is a first-rate ratter, so much so that there isn&#8217;t a
single rat in her house.</p>

<p>Now to the next house through the bananas. It
is like the last and very much the same kind of things
are lying about. But instead of a cat we are met by
the usual African yellow-haired dog. He, too, is
suspicious of us, but retires growling. A hen is busy
scraping among the rubbish at the side of the house
to provide food for her numerous offspring that
chirping follow her motherly cluck! cluck!</p>

<p>Between this house and the last stand the grain
stores, round giant basket-like things with thatched
roofs. The largest ones are for holding the maize,
and the small ones for storing away the beans. That
low building there built of very strong poles is the
goat house. It needs to be strong as the hy&aelig;na
and leopard, and even the lion sometimes pay the
village a visit at night. And woe betide the poor
goats if a fierce leopard should get in among them.
Not satisfied with killing and eating one he will
tear open as many as he can, simply for the pure love
of killing.</p>

<p>The houses in the village are all much the same as
that you have already read about and number about
twenty. They are built here, there, and everywhere
with no regard to plan or regularity. The corner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of the verandah of this one projects out over the
footpath, and we have actually to cross the verandah
to get down to the well. The owner only laughs
when we ask him why he built his house so near to,
and partly upon the path. Some day he says he
will hoe a new path to go round about his house.
That is African all over. He will do things some
day. He thinks the European mad to be such a
slave to time.</p>

<p>The owner of each house greets us with a smile,
and we are well received by all except some of the old
people who are really afraid of white people, and who,
while glad to see them when they come to visit their
village, are still more glad when they go away. We
have gathered quite a crowd of little people about
us, and they follow us round very respectfully, watching
all we do, and looking at all we have on. Many of
them you see suffer from ulcers.</p>

<p>Here and there are patches of tobacco and sweet
potatoes, but most of the gardens are outside the
village proper. Their chief crops are maize, millet,
sweet potatoes and cassava root. Paths twist about
and cross one another in a marvellous manner. This
one leads down to the stream, that to the next village;
this to the graveyard in yonder thicket, a place shunned
by the children, that to the hill. A white stranger
promptly gets lost in African paths and has to give
himself up to the guidance of the native. The whole
country is a vast net-work of such snake-like paths,
and I verily believe you could pass from one coast
to the other along them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AN AFRICAN VILLAGE</p>

<p>But just as we get to the far end of the village
there is something to interest us. It is a very small
house well fenced in. On the roof and exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the sun and rain are spread and tied down a blanket
and various calicoes. This must be the grave of someone
important. It is, and we ask to be allowed to
see inside. Permission is given because it would
not be polite to refuse it, not because it is given
willingly. It proves to be the grave of the headman
of the village who died about a year ago. His clothes
and blanket, of no further use, have been spread over
the roof covering the grave, and on the grave itself
are lying his pots and baskets and drinking cups.
In a small dish some snuff has been placed.</p>

<p>His house which was only a few yards away had
been destroyed with much ceremony after the death
of the owner, and the site is now heavily overgrown
with castor oil plants and self-sown tomatoes. Not
far from where his house had been is the tree at
the foot of which he had offered up sacrifices to the
spirits of his forefathers. Being the chief of the
village he was buried beside his house and not away
in the bush where the common people are laid to rest.
I asked the children if they were not afraid of this
grave in the middle of the village, and they said that
during the day they were not afraid because the noises
of the village kept the spirits away. All the time
we were visiting this sacred place the old woman
with the &#8220;pelele&#8221; was following us at a short distance,
not at all too pleased to see us pry into such places,
but too afraid to tell us so. She was much relieved
when our steps were turned elsewhere.</p>

<p>Such is the home of the African children. Here
they are born and grow up and play and laugh and
cry to their heart&#8217;s content. It is a careless, easy
life with nothing beyond food and clothing to be
interested in, and not a thought for the morrow. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
we are here to give them a new interest in life. In
this large courtyard we gather all the people of the
village together, and with the western sun shining
upon the little crowd we tell them of Jesus and give
them something more to talk about than ourselves
and our clothes. Here in the quiet of this African
village, surrounded by the banana trees, is told once
more the story of the love of Jesus. The old woman
with the ring in her lip says our words are only white
men&#8217;s tales, and will go on in her own way teaching
the children the superstitions of her forefathers.</p>

<p>The seed we sow will not all fall on stony places.
Some of it will fall on good ground and bear fruit in
the lives of these simple village people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> black children are small, the boys and girls
play together; but when they grow up a bit the boys
separate themselves from the girls and have their
own games. They would never dream now of playing
with the girls. The latter are not strong and brave
like boys, and must play by themselves. In this
respect they are just like white boys who feel ashamed
to play with girls.</p>

<p>One of the boy&#8217;s greatest enjoyments is to go
hunting in the woods with their bows and arrows.
It is small birds they want, and their keen eyes scan
the leafy boughs for victims of any kind. It does not
matter how small or pretty a bird may be, down it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
comes struck by a heavy-headed arrow. Victim and
arrow fall back down at the feet of the cunning
shooter. The reason why the boys kill even the
smallest bird is that everything, no matter how small,
will be eaten. They do not eat meat as white people do.
All they want is just enough to make their porridge
tasty and to let them have gravy. So any small animal,
such as you would despise, is acceptable to them.</p>

<p>Pushing through the bush is difficult work, but the
black boys do not seem to mind it although the grass
towers far above their heads. All they fear is, that
perhaps they may tread upon a snake or disturb
a wild beast, but in the excitement of the chase they
soon forget all about snakes and wild beasts. Should
a boy be very good at imitating the call of birds he
gets ready an arrow with many heads&mdash;six or seven.
This he makes by splitting up one end of a thin bamboo
and sharpening each piece. These ends he ties in
such a way as to separate them from one another,
leaving one in the middle. He then takes his bow
and his newly made arrow and goes off to the bush.
Having selected a likely spot he quickly pulls the
grass together loosely over his head to hide him
from above, crouches under it and begins to imitate
the call of a certain bird of which kind he sees many
about. In a short time the birds come hovering
over the grass concealment, and the boy, watching
his chance, sends his arrow into their midst. In this
way several birds are obtained at a time.</p>

<p>Then the boys hunt small game, such as rabbits,
with their dogs. The dogs chase the rabbits out of
the long grass, and the boys stand ready to knock
them over with their knobbed sticks. Another
favourite occupation is to go down to the gardens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
with hoes and dig out field-mice which are relished
just as much as the birds are.</p>

<p>Traps of various kinds are set to catch game.
Some are made with propped-up stones that fall
down and crush the unwary victims. Some are
made with a running noose that strangles the unfortunate
beast. A very simple kind for catching
birds is made out of a long bamboo. A spot is first
chosen where birds are likely to gather together
quickly. The bamboo is then split up the middle
for about a third of its length. The ends, which
if left to themselves would spring together with a
snap, are held wide apart by a cross-pin of wood.
To this pin is attached a long string which goes away
over to the grass where the youthful trapper lies
hidden. A handful of grain is then scattered over
the space between the split ends of the bamboo.
When everything is prepared the eager youth retires
to hide in the grass and watch the birds. It is not
long before several are enjoying the bait, and when
a sufficient number have entered, the boy pulls the
string which displaces the cross-pin and the two ends
of the bamboo close together with a snap. The poor
birds are not all quick enough to escape, and several
lie dead to reward the cunning of the trapper. Such
doings you would hardly call games, but so they are
considered by the black boy, for whenever I ask
them to tell me what games they play at, hunting
and trapping are always among those given me.</p>

<p>Of games proper, hand-ball is a great favourite,
and is played in the courtyard or any other cleared
space. This is a kind of ball-play in which two sides
contend against one another for possession of the ball,
which is usually just a lump of raw rubber. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the sides have been chosen, and it matters not how
many a side so long as there are plenty, the game is
started by a player throwing the ball to another boy
on his side. Thus the ball passes through the air from
player to player, it being the endeavour of the opposite
side to intercept it and of the first lot to retain possession
of it. Every time the ball is caught all the
players with the exception of him who holds the ball,
clap their hands together once and sometimes stamp
with their feet.</p>

<p>The players may dodge about as they like and jump
as high as they like in their endeavour to catch the
ball. It is an excellent game and a hard one, and
would be enjoyed, I am sure, by white boys, for no
lazy bones need ever think he would get the ball.
Only he who is quick of hand and eye would ever get
a chance, and the more clever the players, the harder
is the game. After the ball has gone round one side
a certain number of times the players on that side
shout out a little chorus and clap their hands to
proclaim their victory. Then the game begins
afresh and is carried on with such vigour that when
finished each boy is sweating freely and glad to
retire to a cool place to rest.</p>

<p>A quiet game in contrast to the hand-ball is the
native game of draughts in which the opponents
&#8220;eat&#8221; one another to use the native expression. Four
rows of little holes are made in a shady place. The
opponents sit on opposite sides and each has command
of two rows. Sometimes there are six and at
other times eight holes in each row. Each player
has a number of seeds or little pieces of stone or other
small things, about the size of marbles and he places
one in each hole leaving a certain one empty. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
begin mysterious movements of taking out and putting
in. So it seems to the European at first. But there
are rules, and the black boys know them well. The
idea is to move one&#8217;s own &#8220;men&#8221; one hole along at
a time, until those in any hole surpass in number
those in the enemy&#8217;s hole opposite when they are
taken and placed out of the game. The game is
won when one is able to take the last remaining
&#8220;man&#8221; on his opponent&#8217;s side. To the boys it is
a very engrossing game, and they often forget all
about time over it. Sometimes the holes are chiselled
out on a board and the game played by the grown-up
people on the verandah of their houses.</p>

<p>Quite a different game from any of those described
is that played by both boys and girls among the
cassava bushes in the gardens. When one finds a
single leaf growing in a fork of a bush he calls out
to his neighbour, &#8220;I have bound you.&#8221; The neighbour
considers himself bound till he finds a leaf in a similar
position, when he calls out, &#8220;I have freed myself.&#8221;
He who first finds the leaf binds the other, and so the
game goes on till the children are tired of it. The
boys have another use for the cassava leaf. They
pluck a nice big one. Then the left hand is closed
fist-like, but leaving a hollow in the hand. The leaf
is then laid across the hollow, resting on the thumb
and the bent fore-finger. The open, right hand is
now brought down whack upon the leaf, which is
split in two with a loud report.</p>

<p>Hide-and-seek you all know. I think it must be
played by children all over the world. It is played
by the black children of Africa and enjoyed very much.
There are splendid opportunities for hiding in the
long grass. You have only to go into it a few feet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and you are completely hidden. Sometimes the
black children vary the game from the ordinary hide-and-seek.
The seeker will be a wild beast&mdash;say a
lion&mdash;and the hiders will be deer. They go off and
hide in the grass and the lion has to find his prey.
Sometimes the hider will represent a deer and go
and conceal himself, and the seekers will be hunters
on the chase. Then if there is water near one will
hide in the water and pretend to be a crocodile, and
when the others come down to the stream to bathe
or draw water the crocodile rushes out on them and
tries to seize them by the legs.</p>

<p>The boys also play at war with tiny bows and arrows
made of grass stalks. They stand in rows facing one
another and try to &#8220;kill&#8221; one another with their
arrows.</p>

<p>There is another good game played by the boys
called &#8220;nsikwa.&#8221; It has no English name or I would
have written it instead of the native one. There are
sides in this game, but two boys can play it. Of
course the fun is better when there are perhaps four
or five a side. The boys sit in the courtyard in lines
facing one another and about ten feet apart. In
front of each player is placed a small piece of maize
cob about two or three inches high, from which the
grain has been taken. It is then very light and easily
overturned. In his right hand each player holds a
native top. When all are ready, the players send
their tops spinning across the clear space with great
force and try to knock down the piece of maize cob
belonging to the player opposite. To and fro in the
battle are whirled the tops to the accompaniment of
shouts and laughter of opponents and onlookers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>Most of the games I have seen are boys&#8217; games, but
the girls of Africa can play too like the girls of other
lands. But their play mostly consists of trying to
do what they see their mothers do. Thus the girls
will seize the pestles and try to pound at the mortars.
Others will take the winnowing baskets and try if
they can do as well as mother in sifting out the hard
grains from the fine flour. They also play at keeping
house and marriages. They borrow pots and cooking
utensils from their mothers and go to the bush and
build little houses and make believe to set up house
on their own account. If they play this game in the
village the girls mark out the walls of the supposed
houses with sand, and say, &#8220;Here is my hearth, there
is my sleeping place, and this is the doorway.&#8221;
They also make food with mud and invite one another
to afternoon mud cakes, and pretending to eat them
throw the mud over their shoulders.</p>

<p>When the big people of the village go to work in
the gardens the children often go to the bush and
build little houses and bring flour and maize and other
kinds of food and play at a new village. Then one
will be chosen to be a hyena and another will be
a cock. The hyena goes off to the grass and hides,
and the cock struts about the village. Then someone
will call out, &#8220;It is night, let us go to sleep.&#8221; So
they all go to sleep, and in a short time the cock will
crow, &#8220;Kokoliliko,&#8221; which is the black boys&#8217; way of
saying &#8220;Cock-a-doodle-do.&#8221; The hyena will also
roar.</p>

<p>Those in the house will awake, and one will say,
&#8220;It is daybreak,&#8221; but others will say, &#8220;It is only
that foolish cock crowing in the middle of the night.&#8221;
Then hearing the hyena one will get up, open the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
door cautiously, and chase the beast away. When
the big people go back to the village the children
are not long in following them.</p>

<p>Boys and girls also play at funerals. One will
pretend to be dead, and the others will gather round
in sorrow and mourn over the dead one and lift him
up with great ceremony and bear him off for burial.
But if I make this chapter any longer I am afraid
I may tire you. Let me finish with just one more
pastime. Some of the black children play at making
little animals out of mud, just as white boys and girls
play at mud-pies. The African women do not bake
pies, so the children know nothing of the pleasures
of mud-pie making. Instead, they make little mud
dogs and hens and lions and snakes. These they
put out into the sun where they get baked hard.
They can then be carried about and played with.</p>

<p>These games are some of the many played by
African children, and I hope you will like reading
about them. If you could only see the black children
play them in this sunny land I am sure you would
enjoy it and want to join them. I have watched
them often, and as often wished I had a camera to
take living pictures of African children at play so that
you children at home might be able to see with your
own eyes something of what I have but feebly tried
to describe to you.</p>

<small>FAIRY TALES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Africans are great story-tellers. At night round
the fire, when darkness covers the land and the boys
appetites are appeased, many are the tales told.
Let me translate one or two for you.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a</span></h3>

<p>Long ago there lived a man named Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a.
He was a very foolish man, for he smoked bhang, and
the fumes of this deadly weed had run off with all
his wisdom. One day the chief of the village in
which Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a lived ordered all the people into
his gardens to hoe for him, so that the maize might
not &#8220;walk&#8221; with the grass&mdash;that it, might not be
overgrown.</p>

<p>All the people obeyed the chief&#8217;s words and went
early in the morning to the gardens, followed by the
chief himself. But Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a lingered on in the
village to have a morning pipe of his favourite bhang.
Afterwards, when all the people were already in the
gardens hoeing away under the eye of the chief,
Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a came on alone. On his way he crossed
over a stream and arrived at the plain near which
were the chief&#8217;s gardens.</p>

<p>Lying on the side of the path was an old skull
that had been there for many a day, and which
Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a had often passed. But to-day, because
he had been smoking bhang, he was annoyed at it,
and took the handle of his hoe and struck the skull,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
saying, &#8220;Tell me, what killed you?&#8221; To his horror
the skull moved, and said, &#8220;My tongue killed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a was dreadfully afraid, and his
knees shook under him hearing this dead thing speak
so. But he plucked up courage and struck it again
to see if it was really true, and again the skull spoke
the same words. Being unable to stand it any longer,
for his courage at this second exhibition had deserted
him, he turned and fled as fast as his tottering legs
could carry him to where the people were digging
in the chief&#8217;s gardens, and lost no time in telling his
story.</p>

<p>At first the people refused to believe him, but
because of his earnestness and his frightened condition
the chief ordered all the people to stop hoeing,
and follow him back to the plain where he, the chief,
would himself see this wonderful thing. Arrived
at the spot the people stood round about in a
frightened circle with Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a and the chief
in the centre. Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a was brave now because
of the crowd of people and, lifting his hoe, struck the
poor skull a violent blow, saying, &#8220;Tell me, what
killed you?&#8221; But the skull answered not a word.
Again and again he struck it and demanded it to tell,
but never a word spoke it.</p>

<p>The people saw now that they had been deceived,
and the chief was mad with rage at having been made
appear foolish before the eyes of the people and at
the loss of time from the hoeing. So he ordered
poor Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a to be put to death there and then,
and his head to be cut off and thrown beside the
skull as a warning to all to speak the truth.</p>

<p>When the execution was over and the people had
all departed the skull turned round to poor Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
head, and said, &#8220;My friend, Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a, tell
me, what killed you?&#8221; And Naling&#8217;ang&#8217;a replied,
&#8220;My tongue.&#8221; &#8220;As with me,&#8221; said the skull, &#8220;my
tongue caused a great quarrel and the people killed
me.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Freeman and his Slaves</span></h3>

<p>There was a freeman that had many slaves and
he went with them on a journey. When they were
on the journey the slaves sent the freeman, saying,
&#8220;Go for water.&#8221; But he refused, and the slaves
themselves went and drew water. When they returned
with the water the freeman said, &#8220;Give me
some water to drink.&#8221; But the slaves refused,
saying, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want you to drink our water.
Go to the well and draw water for yourself.&#8221; So
the freeman had to go to the well himself. When he
was about to drink, the slaves pushed him into the
water and killed him. But a drop of blood leapt
upwards and fell on a leaf of a tree, and thereupon
became a bird and sang:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Ku! Ku! Ku!&#8221;</p>

<p>The slaves got ready for their journey, but the bird
went before them and came to the village, and said,
&#8220;They killed me. Make beer when the strangers
come.&#8221; When the slaves entered the house to drink
the beer the people set fire to the house and burned
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Children and the Serpent</span></h3>

<p>There was a certain man that hoed his garden, and
said, &#8220;Now that I have hoed my garden, what shall
I do? These children finish the food in the garden.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Then he went to look for bark and made a rope out
of it and put it into the garden. When the children
said, &#8220;Let us steal,&#8221; the rope became a serpent that
drove off the children, who ran to the village, and
said, &#8220;Father, in the garden yonder there is a snake.&#8221;
And he said, &#8220;Let us go there and see.&#8221; When they
came to the garden the father said, &#8220;Look now,
that is a rope. You thought it was a snake. Is it
that you were stealing the maize? You must never
do so again.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are African fairy tales, but there is a very
great difference between a written story and one told
by word of mouth. The teller stands up and, with
hands going and eyes rolling and body bending
backwards and forwards, imitates whatever birds
or beasts, their calls and their cries, there are in his
tale. At intervals he sings out a line or two of chorus,
which is taken up by the audience and sung with great
delight. Many additions are made in the spoken
tale, and the written one is but the shadow of the
other.</p>

<small>ANIMAL STORIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> let me get you a few animal stories of which I
am sure there must be hundreds stored up in the
hearts of the black boys and girls. Where they learn
them I know not, but they all seem to be able to tell
stories. I really do believe they are born with them
in their hearts all ready for the telling.</p>

<p>Among the animals, strange to say, the rabbit is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
considered the cunning one. White children are
accustomed to hear of the sly fox who said the grapes
were sour; his place in Africa is taken by Mr Rabbit.
Many are the tricks he plays on animals big and
small, and even on people. The foolish animal is
the hyena, and on him very often falls the punishment
that ought to be borne by the cunning rabbit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Rabbit and the Elephant</span></h3>

<p>A rabbit made friends with an elephant, and they
agreed together to hoe a large garden. While they
were busy hoeing, the head of the rabbit&#8217;s hoe fell out,
and as he could not see a stone on which to knock
his hoe, he was at a loss to know what to do. Suddenly
a good plan entered his head, and, turning to
the elephant, he said, &#8220;Friend Elephant, let me
knock in my hoe on your head.&#8221; The elephant
agreed, and the hoe was knocked in by the rabbit.
Then they went on hoeing again. Not long after
the head of the elephant&#8217;s hoe fell off. So, turning
to the rabbit, he said, &#8220;Friend Rabbit, let me knock
in my hoe on your head.&#8221; But the rabbit, being
afraid that the elephant would kill him, refused and
ran off. On his way he met a hyena, who asked
him why he was running at such a break-neck speed.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; replied the rabbit, &#8220;the elephant has much
meat in the garden yonder. Go to him and you
will be sure to get a bit. I am running to get a knife
to cut it up.&#8221; When the elephant saw the hyena
coming, he thought it was still the rabbit who had
&#8220;bewitched&#8221; himself to be like another beast. So he
caught him and killed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Rabbit and the
Hippopotamus</span></h3>

<p>A rabbit, going down to the river to drink, met a
hippopotamus and began to speak to him. Not far
away was an elephant feeding on the trees near the
bank of the river. &#8220;Come, let us try our strength,&#8221;
said the rabbit to the hippopotamus, &#8220;you try to
pull me into the water and I shall try to pull you to
the bank, and whoever is pulled over must pay the
other.&#8221; But the hippopotamus would not listen
to such a proposal and laughed, saying, &#8220;Why should
I waste time pulling with a creature so small as you?&#8221;
But the rabbit urged him very much to have a try,
so at last he consented. Then the rabbit went off
to find a rope, but in passing the elephant, who was
feeding quietly, he challenged him to a similar trial of
strength, but this time the rabbit was to try to pull
the elephant into the water. Like the hippopotamus,
the elephant at first refused. But in the end he
consented. So the rabbit gave him one end of the
rope, saying that he would go down into the water
and begin to pull. When he reached the river, however,
he gave the other end of the rope to the hippopotamus,
saying he would now run back and begin to
pull. Then the rabbit, pretending to go to pull his end
of the rope, slyly lay down in the grass and watched.
Then the two great animals began to pull and tug
against one another but neither could pull the other
over, and all the time the rabbit lay laughing in the
grass. All day the great beasts heaved and tugged at
the rope. About sunset, quite worn out, they gave up
the tug-of-war. The rabbit ran to the river bank
where the hippopotamus was standing exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
half out of the water with the sand all trampled
round about. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the rabbit, &#8220;how did
I pull?&#8221; The poor hippopotamus had to own up
that he was beaten and agreed to pay. Thereupon
the rabbit ran to where the elephant still panted
amidst trampled grass and brushwood, and said,
&#8220;Well, how did I pull?&#8221; The elephant also had to
own defeat and agreed to pay. Thus was the rabbit
made rich in a single day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Rabbit and the Lion Cubs</span></h3>

<p>A rabbit once wanted to wear a lion&#8217;s skin, so he
said, &#8220;Where shall I find one?&#8221; But his friends
said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it. The lion is a fearful
animal.&#8221; But the rabbit said, &#8220;I shall deceive it.&#8221;
So he went to a lion&#8217;s den where there were cubs,
stood in the courtyard, and clapped his hands. The
lioness came out and received his salutation and
said, &#8220;Well, what?&#8221; And the rabbit replied, &#8220;I
have come to stay.&#8221; So the lioness said, &#8220;Pass
into the house there and take care of the children.
Remain with them, and I myself shall go to kill game.&#8221;
Then she went away to kill game. Not long afterwards
the lioness came back and stood in the path
and called out, saying, &#8220;Rabbit.&#8221; And the rabbit
said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Take this meat.
Are all the children well?&#8221; And the rabbit replied,
&#8220;Yes, they are all well.&#8221; &#8220;All right,&#8221; said the
lioness, &#8220;bring them that I may see them.&#8221; So
the rabbit brought them, and said, &#8220;This is one, this
is another, and this another.&#8221; In all there were
three. Quite pleased, the lioness said, &#8220;Take the
meat and give it them.&#8221; The rabbit went and received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the meat, but ate it all himself and the children
got none. Then the lioness went off to kill more
meat. When she had gone the rabbit took one child,
killed it, took off its skin, and went away to hide it.
The lioness soon returned, bringing more game, and
said, &#8220;Are the children well? Bring them that
I may see them.&#8221; So the rabbit brought them, saying,
&#8220;This is one, this is another, and this another,&#8221; but
one he brought twice. Again, well pleased, the lioness
went away for more game, and the rabbit killed another
cub, took off its skin, and went away and hid it. In
the evening the lioness again returned, bringing meat,
and said, &#8220;Are the children all well?&#8221; As usual
the rabbit replied, &#8220;Yes, they are all well.&#8221; So he
showed the lioness the same cub three times, and said,
&#8220;This is one, this is another, and this another.&#8221; Again,
well pleased, the lioness said, &#8220;Take this meat and
give it them.&#8221; But the rabbit ate it all, and afterwards
killed the cub that was left, skinned it, and
went off to hide the skin. Then, afraid of the return
of the lioness, he went to get string. Next he cut
a small slave stick and tied himself by the neck.
Then he twisted cords and tied his legs and bound
himself to the stick again, and with another cord
tied his arms. Then he made a great noise, and called
out, &#8220;War! War! War against the lion. War!&#8221;
The lioness came bounding back, and said, &#8220;What is
the matter?&#8221; So the rabbit said, &#8220;The children
are all taken, the soldiers carried them off.&#8221; And
the lioness demanded, &#8220;Soldiers from where?&#8221;
And the rabbit said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Untie me.&#8221;
The lioness set about untying, and the rabbit said,
&#8220;Wait for me, I shall go in search of them.&#8221; So
the rabbit went away and found monkeys spinning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
their tops, saying, &#8220;Go! Go!&#8221; But the rabbit
said, &#8220;Yes, nonsense, but you should say, &#8216;I have
killed a lion and taken off his skin.&#8217;&#8221; The monkeys
said, &#8220;Yes, very good,&#8221; and the rabbit left the monkeys
repeating these words. He himself went back and
met the lioness, and said, &#8220;The children were killed
by these monkeys.&#8221; So the lioness said, &#8220;Deceive
them, saying that we will do trade in tops.&#8221; So the
rabbit went back to the monkeys, and said, &#8220;Let us
deal in these tops.&#8221; So they said, &#8220;With what
goods?&#8221; And the rabbit said, &#8220;With beans.&#8221; Then
the monkeys said, &#8220;Well, bring them that we may
buy.&#8221; So the rabbit went back and told all to the
lioness, who said, &#8220;Weave a basket and tie me into
it.&#8221; And the rabbit wove a basket, tied in the lioness,
and put a few beans on top, lifted the basket, and
departed. When he arrived at their courtyard he
found the monkeys spinning their tops. So he
called out, &#8220;I have brought that merchandise.&#8221;
And they replied, &#8220;We shall buy it.&#8221; Just then a
monkey sent his top spinning, saying, &#8220;I have killed
a lion&#8217;s cub and have taken off its skin.&#8221; So the
rabbit whispered to the lioness, &#8220;Listen, those fellows
killed the children;&#8221; then to the monkeys, &#8220;Let us
go and sell in this house.&#8221; Then the rabbit took
a knife and cut the ropes that held the lioness, who
sprang out upon the poor monkeys and killed them
all. But the rabbit went for his skins and took them
home and wore them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Tortoise and the Monkey</span></h3>

<p>Once a tortoise and a monkey made friends, and
the monkey said to the tortoise, &#8220;Friend Tortoise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
come to my home and visit.&#8221; So the tortoise went
and the monkey cooked food for him, but, wishing
to play a trick on him, placed it on a high platform
which the tortoise could not possibly reach up to.
Then he called the tortoise, saying, &#8220;Friend Tortoise,
go into the house and eat.&#8221; When the tortoise went
in expecting a feast he found the food so high up
that he could not reach it. So he came out very
angry, and said, &#8220;Friend Monkey, you have been
insolent to me.&#8221; So he went home, and brooded over
the insult for three days. Then he sent a messenger
to invite the monkey to his home, saying to himself,
&#8220;Yon monkey was cheeky to me, I also will be cheeky
to him.&#8221; So when the monkey came he found food
already cooked and eyed it greedily. But the tortoise
said, &#8220;Friend Monkey, there is no water in the house,
go down to the stream and wash your hands.&#8221; So
the monkey went down through the burned grass
and washed his hands in anticipation of the feast.
But in coming back from the stream he had to pass
again through the burned grass and his hands were as
black as ever. So seeing through the tortoise&#8217;s
cunning he got angry, and said, &#8220;My friend has played
a trick on me,&#8221; and departed to his own home.</p>

<small>FINGER RHYMES AND RIDDLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I have told you four African tales of animals,
and perhaps you are tired of such stories. If, however,
I can remember a very good one before I am finished
writing to you I shall put it into this chapter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>Let me now tell you about the black boys and girls&#8217;
riddles, and there are one or two nursery rhymes that
I know of. I am sure you would like to hear them,
so I shall write them down for you as they are spoken
here, and then translate them for you. Here is one
of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Uyu ndi mtecheteche,</div>
<div class="indent">Uyu ndi mpwache wa mteche,</div>
<div class="indent2">Uyu ndi mkala pakati,</div>
<div class="indent3">Uyu ndi mkomba mbale,</div>
<div class="indent4">Uyu ndi chitsiru chache,</div>
<div class="verse">Tikumenya iwe: Go! Go!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Can you guess what this is all about? You have a
rhyme that means just the same. Well this is what
these funny words mean:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;This is the shaky little finger,</div>
<div class="indent">This is his younger brother,</div>
<div class="indent2">This is the one in the middle,</div>
<div class="indent3">This is the plate-scraper,</div>
<div class="indent4">This is an old fool,</div>
<div class="verse">I beat you thus: Go! Go!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is you see an African finger rhyme. You have
all one of your own, but I am sure in it you never
call your fore-finger a plate-scraper, nor your thumb
an old fool. But if you had to eat without spoons
and knives and forks, and wanted to make your plate
very clean you would have to use your fore-finger
a good deal, and you would then understand why
the black children call it a plate-scraper.</p>

<p>This is another finger rhyme for counting up all
the fingers:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Then about guesses. I have tried to pick out one
or two just to let you hear what like they are. Many
of the answers to riddles I have heard seemed to me
to have little or no point in them. So it is with the
stories. But when I have failed to see the joke and
have not laughed the black boys have not failed. They
have their own funny stories and laugh at them
heartily. But our jokes they do not understand,
nor do they play pranks on one another as white
boys do. Let me try to tell you how you can make
black boys and girls roar with laughter, and yet to
a white man there is nothing to laugh about. If
you are telling them about people scattering helter-skelter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and say that the people, &#8220;nalimenya,&#8221; which
means go off helter-skelter, the boys will go into fits
of laughter. Now I can see nothing to laugh at in
this, and I am sure you can&#8217;t either, and, if another
word had been used, neither would the black boy.
But here is the peculiar thing. It is the &#8220;li&#8221; in the
middle of the word that makes it funny to African
children here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Menya&#8221; means &#8220;beat,&#8221; but &#8220;<i>li</i>menya&#8221; means
&#8220;run off helter-skelter.&#8221; Again &#8220;Sesa&#8221; means
&#8220;sweep,&#8221; but &#8220;<i>li</i>sesa&#8221; means &#8220;run off helter-skelter;&#8221;
and so on with a lot of other words, the
addition of the syllable &#8220;li&#8221; makes them change
their meanings entirely, and become &#8220;run off helter-skelter,&#8221;
and so very funny that black boys and
girls cannot keep from laughing. Now for the
guesses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;What is yonder and here at the same time?&#8221;</div>

<div class="verse">&#8220;I had a big garden, yet got no food from it.&#8221;</div>

<div class="verse">&#8220;My hen laid an egg among thorns.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent4"><i>Answer</i>&mdash;The tongue and the teeth.</div>

<p>I think you will understand these answers to the
above guesses, but what do you think of this one?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;In my mother&#8217;s house there is money.&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent4"><i>Answer</i>&mdash;Baldness.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>I am certain you and I would never have thought
of such an answer.</p>

<p>Here are one or two of their proverbs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sleep knows no friendship, has no favourite.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;If your neighbour&#8217;s beard takes fire, quench it;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>which latter means&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Help your neighbour now, for some day you may need help.&#8221;</p>

<p>By means of these guesses the African children while
away the time and amuse themselves on wet days
or on cold nights round the fire by asking them from
one another. Now let me close this chapter by telling
you the story of</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Rabbit, the Lion, and the Wild Pig</span></h3>

<p>There was once a lion that knew all about medicine.
He did a good trade with people who came to buy
it. One day some people from a far country came
and begged him to come with them to heal their
sick. So the lion agreed, and set about to get a servant
to carry his bundle on the journey. Finding a wild
pig near, he called him, saying, &#8220;Come, friend Pig,
will you go on that journey?&#8221; and the pig agreed.
So the lion gave him the load to carry.</p>

<p>When they were on the way the lion said to the
pig, &#8220;Look there, Master Pig, that is the medicine
for porridge. If they make porridge for us at the
end of our journey you must run and get some of
these leaves.&#8221; The pig said, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and they
went on their journey.</p>

<p>While they were passing another bush the lion said
again, &#8220;Look there, Master Pig, that is the medicine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
for rice. If they make rice you must run and get
some of these leaves.&#8221; The pig again said, &#8220;All right,&#8221;
and they continued their journey.</p>

<p>When they reached the village of the sick people
the lion and pig were well received. In the evening
porridge was cooked for them, and the lion said to
the pig, &#8220;Master Pig, go and get yon leaves.&#8221; So
Master Pig ran off to get the leaves. When he came
back with them he found that the lion had finished
all the porridge. So that night Master Pig went to
bed hungry. Next evening the people cooked rice,
and the lion said to the pig, &#8220;Master Pig, go and
get yon leaves;&#8221; and Master Pig set off in a hurry
to bring the leaves. But when he got back, all puffing
and blowing, he found that the lion had just finished
the rice, and he had to go hungry to bed.</p>

<p>Next day they returned home, and the poor pig
arrived at his village in a famished condition, to the
great sorrow of his wife and children.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards other people came requesting
the services of Dr Lion to heal their sick, and he
agreed to go.</p>

<p>Looking around for a carrier he spied the rabbit, and
said, &#8220;Come, friend Rabbit, will you go on that
journey?&#8221; and the rabbit agreed. So the lion gave
him his load to carry.</p>

<p>When they were on the way the lion said to the
rabbit, &#8220;Master Rabbit, do you see that bush? That
is the medicine for porridge. If they make porridge
for us at the village you must run and get these
leaves.&#8221; &#8220;All right,&#8221; said the rabbit, and they
continued their journey. But they had not gone
far when the rabbit stopped, and said, &#8220;Where is my
knife; I must have left it where we rested. Let me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
run back to get it.&#8221; &#8220;All right,&#8221; said the lion,
&#8220;don&#8217;t be long.&#8221; So the rabbit ran back, pulled
some leaves from the medicine bush, and hid them
in the load. When he reached the lion they resumed
their journey. Soon the lion stopped again at another
bush, and said, &#8220;Master Rabbit, do you see that bush?
That is medicine for rice. If they cook rice for us
at the village you must run and get these leaves.&#8221;
The rabbit said, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and they went on their
way.</p>

<p>But in a short time the rabbit stopped, and said,
&#8220;Where is my knife? I must have left it where
we rested. Let me run back for it.&#8221; The lion was
very angry this time, and said, &#8220;What kind of a servant
are you, always losing your knife? Don&#8217;t be long.&#8221;
So the rabbit ran back not to find his knife but to
pull the medicine leaves for rice, which he hid in his
bundle. When he made up on the lion again they
continued their journey and soon arrived at the
village.</p>

<p>In the evening porridge was cooked for the visitors,
and the lion said to the rabbit, &#8220;Master Rabbit, go
and get yon leaves.&#8221; So the rabbit untied his bundle
and produced the leaves. The lion was so angry at
seeing the leaves thus produced that he could not eat
a bite, and the rabbit had all the porridge to himself.
Next evening rice was cooked for them, and the lion
said to the rabbit, &#8220;Master Rabbit, go for yon leaves.&#8221;
But the rabbit again just opened his load and produced
the leaves, and the lion was so sick and angry
that he could not touch the rice, which the rabbit
ate all to himself.</p>

<p>Next day they started on their homeward journey,
and the first night slept in the same house, the lion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
in a bed, the rabbit on a piece of bark. During the
night the rabbit said out aloud, &#8220;He who sleeps on
bark will be fresh for his journey in the morning,
but he who sleeps in a bed will walk heavily and
with pain.&#8221; The lion on hearing this got out of bed,
saying, &#8220;You little one, get off that bark, I myself
will sleep there.&#8221; So they changed sleeping places.
In the middle of the night the rabbit got up and lit
a fire while the lion slept. The heat of the fire soon
caused the bark to shrivel up and tightly enclose
the sleeping giant. Then the rabbit ran off home
and left him.</p>

<p>In the morning great roars were heard coming
from the house and the people, wondering what had
befallen Dr Lion, rushed in and found him struggling
to free himself. With their axes they soon had him
out, and he went home a hungry and sorrowful beast.
When his wife and children saw him looking so thin,
they set up a great crying.</p>

<p>And so people who believe that they are very clever,
will soon find others more clever than they. The
lion thought himself very cunning when he deceived
the poor pig, but he found the rabbit too much for
him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>FOOD AND ORNAMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal dish of the African is a kind of maize
porridge made rather thick, so as to hold together
in lumps. It is for flour to make this porridge that
the women are continually pounding at the mortars.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
The porridge is always eaten with something tasty
to send it down, and is never eaten without this
relish. Now this relish may be simply juicy leaves
got in the bush and boiled as we boil cabbage, or
it may be meat of some kind no matter what, or
it may be fish no matter how high, but it is oftenest
beans&mdash;porridge and beans being the everyday food.
African children have but two regular meals in the
day and the porridge one is the afternoon meal.
The forenoon one may be made of sweet potatoes,
or green maize or pumpkins, or cucumbers&mdash;anything
that does not require much cooking on the part of the
mothers. But from early morning onwards the
children always have an eye for anything that will
help to appease their hunger.</p>

<p>Thus the boys go off early with their bows and
arrows to shoot birds, or they may go digging for
field mice, or setting traps for any small kind of
animal that may be foolish enough to enter them.
These little creatures are skinned and roasted, spitted
on bamboos, and kept ready for porridge time. At
certain seasons of the year a kind of caterpillar is
gathered to be roasted to make relish. I have seen
children with their hands full of yellow-green crawling
things as proud as if they had been a handful
of sweets. Then when the sky is dark with locusts
the children are glad. Knowing the locusts cannot
fly till the sun has warmed them, the boys and girls
go out early in the morning and gather baskets full
of them. The legs and wings are torn off and the
bodies roasted. Then again at the time when the
winged white ants are issuing forth from underground
to fly off and make another home, the cunning children
place a pot over the hole and catch hundreds. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
also they roast and consider delicious. Their sweets
are very few&mdash;wild honey and sugar-cane. They do
like sugar-cane, and tear it and munch it with their
strong white teeth. It is very sweet and not unpleasant
to chew. But a white man must get it cut
into little bits for him before he can enjoy it. He
cannot eat it as the black people do.</p>

<p>Some of the tribes eat frogs and snakes and land-crabs
and snails, but many of them do not. Those
who do not eat such things look down upon those
who do, and consider them savages and altogether
to be despised. Then again in every tribe there are
certain superstitious customs as regards food. A
mother will warn her child, saying, &#8220;My child, you
must never eat rabbit. If you eat rabbit your body
will be covered with sores.&#8221; So this child will refrain
from rabbit, and so on with other kinds of meat,
each child has something or other that is forbidden
to him.</p>

<p>I remember once, when some boys of mine had gone
rabbit-hunting, asking a very small boy who had been
left behind if he was looking forward to the feast
that was to come when the other boys returned, and
how he would enjoy rabbit. &#8220;I don&#8217;t eat rabbit,&#8221;
he replied, in a disconsolate voice. I asked him
why. &#8220;Does not everyone, even the white man, eat
rabbit!&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but my mother
forbade me to eat rabbit, saying if I did, I
would be covered with itch.&#8221; I advised him to
try but he was afraid. Later on in the day, towards
sunset, after the boys had returned from the woods.
I saw the little disconsolate one all smiles. He was
holding in his hand two miserable field mice, and
was as happy as a king. The other boys had remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
he did not eat rabbit, and had put off
half an hour to capture some mice for him that he
might be able to join in the feast.</p>

<p>Besides the food from the gardens there are many
bush fruits that the African children eat. So, as far as
food is concerned, the black boys and girls are very
well off. They have none of the pleasant things you may
buy with your pennies. But then they know nothing
of your nice things, and so they do not feel the want
of them. Give the African child bananas and sugar-cane
and ground nuts, what you call monkey nuts,
I think, and he is as happy as you with your toffy
and chocolate and other sweets.</p>

<p>When a black boy or girl gets up in the morning,
he or she has just a small wash. The real wash comes
later on in the day when it is warmer. But they are
very particular over their teeth and take very good
care of them. In keeping them clean they use toothbrushes
which they make out of little pieces of the
wood of a certain tree about the length of a lead
pencil but rather shorter and stouter. One end is
cut and cut into again and again and teased out till
it makes a very good toothbrush, and with it the
black boy keeps his teeth in good condition. Of
course it must be easy for him, because he can open
his mouth so very wide.</p>

<p>At the real washing he goes down to a quiet pool
and has good fun in the water with his companions.
I have often come across little groups of them, and,
of course, when a white man comes along the children
squat down doubled up to try to hide their nakedness,
making themselves just like a group of brown giant
frogs. Their feet they clean with broken pieces of
rock, and, would you believe it, the soles of their feet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and the palms of their hands are white. It is strange,
but so it is. Their feet, too, are very large and strong
compared with ours, but their hands are generally
very neat and shapely. On these feet they can walk
mile after mile and not feel tired. If a small white
boy walked five miles on a journey and five miles
back he would boast of his endurance. But it is a
common thing for a small black boy to walk twenty
and even thirty miles in a single day and think nothing
about it. In fact, if he could not do it, he would consider
himself a weakling.</p>

<p>Of course in cold weather the children do not
wash at all, and, in some places, when the grown-up
people are not particular, the children wash but
seldom. But on the whole they like to be clean,
especially after having come into contact with white
men, for most white men insist on the black children
keeping themselves clean.</p>

<p class="caption">A BATHING POOL</p>

<p>If you had a black woolly head, like those of the
African children, how would you do your hair? You
would find all your brushes useless, and your combs
would break on the first trial. They would not be
nearly strong enough to get through the mass of short
curls. Have the black children no combs then?
Oh, yes! peculiar combs they make, the teeth of
which point out like fingers, and with these they
comb their woolly pates. But it is in arranging
their hair that they excel. One boy will train a tuft
of hair over his forehead to grow up like a horn.
Another will think he ought to shave out bald
spaces. Some cut the hair on both sides and
leave a ridge in the middle like a cock&#8217;s comb,
while others tie the hair with grasses into little
tufts, and make their heads like miniature cabbage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
gardens. And after a death in the family the hair
is shaved clean off altogether, and the black boy
appears with a head like an ostrich egg. Feathers
and sometimes flowers are stuck into the hair as
decorations.</p>



<p>Teeth, too, come in for some attention. They are
not always allowed to grow as nature wills. In some
of the tribes the boys and girls teeth are filed by their
mothers, each tribe having its own peculiar way of
filing. Sometimes all the teeth are cut into little
notches. Sometimes only the two upper front ones
are done. But the custom is dying out, and many
of the children of the present generation are not
made to submit to such an indignity. Tattooing is
also practised by many tribes. Face, arms, breast,
and back are often done. Again difference of tribes
is shown by these markings. This is how it is performed.
The cuts are first made and allowed a day
or two to heal partly. They are then opened up
again and charcoal rubbed in. The wounds are
then allowed to heal which they do as broad black
raised-up lines. These tatoo marks are quite different
from what is seen on some white people at home.
They are not drawings, but simply little lines, some
straight, some curved, done into a certain tribal
design.</p>

<p>In some tribes the ears are pierced and the hole
made rather large. So large are they in some cases
that I have seen a native carry a roasted mouse
hanging through his ear.</p>

<p>I have already told you about the ring in the upper
lip called the &#8220;pelele,&#8221; so I shall not mention it
again. But some of the women who have given
up the &#8220;pelele&#8221; have taken to wearing a button of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
lead in one side of the nose, which, from our point of
view, does not improve their appearance.</p>

<p>Their persons they adorn with anklets and bracelets
of brass. But in places where there are plenty of
elephants one finds the girls wearing great ivory
bracelets made from the tusks. All kinds of grass
bracelets are plaited and worn by young girls who
can&#8217;t afford to have better ones, and I have sometimes
seen a necklace made by stringing parts of
locust&#8217;s legs and beads together.</p>

<p>Of the beads there is an infinite variety bought
from the trader. These are strung together in many
ways and made into bracelets and necklaces and
various other things which only the patience of
African children could produce.</p>

<small>THE AFRICAN&#8217;S BELIEF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter we shall tell about something altogether
different from what you have been reading.
We shall go into the spirit land of the African children,
and we shall try to find out something of what they
believe about God.</p>

<p>In the great black part of Africa there are no
temples and wonderful gods to write about. There
are no old books to be found containing the wisdom
of their forefathers written down and preserved
through long ages. In fact there is not very much
in native African belief that can be made very
interesting to white boys and girls. But I shall try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
to do my best, to let you understand something
about it.</p>

<p>Some people at home think that the heathen tribes
of Africa know nothing at all about God. But it is
not so. They do know something, be it only a very
very little. In some tribes it is so very little as to be
almost nothing, and shows us how far they have
fallen away from a knowledge of their Creator. Let
me tell you what some of the tribes here believe
about God.</p>

<p>God, our loving heavenly Father, is to them but a
far-away spirit whom they call the old, old one, or
the great, great one. He made the world and everything
in it and sends rain and sunshine, and is all-powerful.
But He is very far away from us and
takes little interest in the people of the earth.</p>

<p>When people die, their spirits, they say, go to the
land of this old, old one. Spirit villages are there,
I have heard it said, inhabited by the spirit folk.
As a man was on earth so is he in the land of the
spirits. So a chief on earth remains a chief in spirit
land. Now, the spirits of the chiefs are supposed
to be on very intimate terms with the old, old one,
and are allowed to do almost whatever they like
with the affairs of the people on earth. So it is the
spirit of the dead chief that receives the sacrifices
and prayers of the people. The old, old one is felt
to be so far away and so indifferent that he is passed
over, in some tribes forgotten altogether, and the
spirit of the chief receives the homage due to the great,
great one, because the people feel that he, the chief,
has a personal interest in them.</p>

<p>The more famous, generally the more fierce, a
chief was on earth in his life-time the more is his help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
asked for after he is dead, and has gone to the land
of the spirits. It is not considered wise to neglect
him in case he revenge himself upon the people.</p>

<p>The spirits of the common people are just ordinary
inhabitants of spirit land and are of no account,
except to their near relatives. A man in private
matters of his own may seek the aid of the spirit
of his father or of his grandfather. But on the whole,
it is the spirit of the chief whom the people knew
and were familiar with that is prayed to and receives
the sacrifices of the people.</p>

<p>The spirits when they wish to speak to the people
may enter into any person and cause that person to
rave like a madman. He retires to the darkness of
a hut while his fit of madness lasts. His sayings
are not set aside as mere idle words, but are remembered
and repeated to the interpreter, generally
an old person, who explains to the people that under
cover of these words spoken in delirium by the person
possessed the spirits mean that so and so should be
done. Dreams also are thought of as journeyings to
the land of the spirits.</p>

<p>Now I think that will be enough about the spirits
for you to understand a little of what many of
the African children believe about the Great Spirit
who made everything. It is only when the children
are big that they are told all these things about the
spirits. The people do not like to talk about such
things, and the children avoid the places where the
spirits are supposed to come and visit. They are
afraid to give offence to the spirits, I think, and, in
fact, all their sacrifices seem to be made with the
idea of appeasing the anger and earning the good
will of the spirits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>Sometimes the sacrifices are made at the base of
a tree. Very often a small hut is built in which
sacrifice is offered up. The offerings are of flour
or native beer, and at other times of animals. Only
small bits of the flesh of the sacrificed animal are
offered, the rest of the meat being eaten by the people.
The bits offered up are wrapped in leaves and placed
at the root of the sacrificial tree. It is the chief
who offers up the sacrifice and says the prayers. In
times of great calamity large sacrifices are held in
which several chiefs join their people together and
make prayer to the departed ones. Sacrifices are
also made for rain, for success in hunting, for safety
in travelling, and for freedom from sickness.</p>

<p>The prayers are generally very simple requests
like the following one for safety, &#8220;Watch over me,
my forefather, who died long ago, and tell the great
spirit at the head of my race from whom came my
mother.&#8221; Here is a short account of a sacrifice for
rain. &#8220;The chief goes to the spirit hut to offer
sacrifice for rain and the people stand round about
having brought the meat for the sacrifice. Then the
chief begins to complain to the spirits saying, &#8216;Give
us rain and do not harden your heart against us.&#8217;
With many other prayers he continues to implore,
while the people round about clap their hands, and
some of the women sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;Kokwe Kolole, Kokwe Kolole</div>

<div class="verse">The rain here has not come;</div>
<div class="verse">May there come rain, sweeping rain.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>When the rain does come the people believe that it
came because they appeased the anger of the great,
great one with their sacrifice.</p>

<p>But wherever the Gospel of Jesus is preached the
people are learning that there has been offered up
for them by God Himself one great sacrifice which
has redeemed the fallen sons of men&mdash;the sacrifice
of His only Son on Calvary&#8217;s Cross.</p>

<small>THE AFRICAN IN SICKNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the children of Africa are well and strong,
their lives are carelessly happy, so long as they are
not hungry. When they are ill, all the happiness
departs, and they become very miserable. You may
have thought that because black children can eat
almost anything that they are never ill. But that
is not so. They suffer, I believe, a good deal more
than white children do. For simple troubles they
get no treatment at all. They are just ill, they say,
and lie on their mats near the fire or sit huddled up
over it until they are better. These little complaints
are mostly all of the stomachache kind, caused by
reckless eating of anything the children can pick up.
I have seen black children eat fruit that was quite
green and hard&mdash;such as would kill little whites&mdash;and
still live. And when you try to explain that
these things can hurt they just smile to themselves
and go on swallowing them, for they don&#8217;t believe
you. Headaches are treated by binding the head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
round the temples tightly with a piece of string.
Sometimes, if the headache is very painful, the
sufferer is bled. Little cuts are made on the
throbbing temples with a sharp knife and the blood
allowed to flow.</p>

<p>It is the mothers who are the doctors and nurses of
the children. Very often the sick child is attended
by his grandmother. These old ladies are supposed
to know a great deal about medicine; and they do
know many plants and roots that are useful in simple
illnesses. For mumps, which many black children
call &#8220;masigwidi,&#8221; no medicine is given. The mothers
tell the children to go to the mortar, put their heads
in and call &#8220;Mooo!&#8221; I don&#8217;t know whether this
simple remedy is a certain cure or not.</p>

<p>The following method of getting rid of the
disease is considered to be very effective. &#8220;The
person sick with &#8216;masigwidi&#8217; goes in the evening
to the house of another person and claps his hands
in salutation. When the inmates reply the owner
of the house takes mumps, and the former sick one
runs off cured.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a child is seriously ill the doctor is called
in, as is the case with white children. The disease
has gone beyond the skill of the mothers and grandmothers,
so better advice must be got. The doctor,
when he comes, is first of all paid a fee. A few fowls
are caught and handed over to him. Then he begins
to treat the sufferer. He keeps his medicine in horns,
not having any bottles. And in these horns are
many weird mixtures. Like the grandmothers&#8217;,
most of his medicine is made from plants and roots,
yet it is wonderful how well they get on with these
simple things. When the patient recovers, another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
fee is charged by the doctor. But if the child dies,
unless if be from some well-known disease like smallpox,
death may be attributed to witchcraft. Someone
has used bad magic against the patient and nothing
could save him.</p>

<p>In the presence of serious trouble, however, these
doctors are very helpless, and when accidents have
happened and bones are broken, and internal injuries
are inflicted, the sufferers are beyond their aid. Here
then is the opportunity for the medical missionary
from the home land. He is able again and again
to help the people when they are most helpless.
Thus he gains their confidence, and a way to their
hearts for the Gospel of Christ. His work is a daily
putting into practice of the teaching of Our Saviour,
and the lesson learned from it is not lost on the African.</p>

<p>African children suffer a great deal from ulcers,
especially on their legs. These are painful sores that
break out on them, and if neglected, as they are, alas!
too often, there is grave danger to the limb. Sores
on the toes are common. You may see in almost
any village, children running about with some of
their toes half eaten away. These sores are caused
by an insect&mdash;the penetrating flea or jigger which
bores its way under the skin and seeks in the warm
flesh a cosy place to bring forth its young. It generally
selects a place under the toe nail as most suitable.
When it enters first, the jigger is very small. But
in a few days it grows big and may become the size
of a small pea. If these pests are not promptly
removed, sores break out on the toes and the toes
crumble away. Now little children are unable to
take them out, and if their mothers neglect to do so,
the children lose their toes. I have often seen boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
armed with stout thorns picking the jiggers out of
one another&#8217;s feet. The process I know, from experience,
is sometimes painful, for the toe under the
nail is very tender, yet the black children seldom
wince when the jiggers are being taken out. They
are brave little things in the presence of physical
pain, but they really do not feel so keenly as you
children do. Their feelings are a good deal blunter
than yours, and so they do not dread pain as much
as you do, for they suffer less.</p>

<p>There are some diseases found among African
children that are not found among white children. Of
these leprosy, the most dreadful, used long ago to
afflict white children too. It is the terrible disease
from which our tender-hearted Saviour freed some
poor sufferers when He was on earth. Alas! one
comes across it now and again among the black races
of Africa.</p>

<p>I remember once meeting a leper. He was a bright
lad and was attending a class for Bible instruction.
Some of the joints of his fingers were gone at the
time I saw him, but he had been a leper for some
years then. He told me that his father had been
a leper, and that he himself began to suffer from
leprosy when he was a boy of some twelve years of
age. The beginning was like this. One morning
he awoke and felt his hands and arms sore as if they
had been burned in spots here and there during the
night. So he blamed the other boys who slept in the
hut for playing tricks on him with a burning stick.
But they all denied it. It was the beginning of the
fatal disease.</p>

<p>The Africans have no treatment for the leper. He
simply lives his life in the village so long as he looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
after himself or can get anyone to care for him. But
when his disease has gone on year after year, and he
is no longer able to walk or do anything for himself,
or has no friend to care for him, the people used to
have, and still have in many places, a savage way of
dealing with him. Back from the village a bit in
the bush a little hut was built, and one day the leper
was carried out, taken to the hut, shut into it with
a supply of food, and left to his fate. Either he
perished from hunger or was devoured by a wild
beast, or was burned to death by a bush-fire. The
natives firmly believe that such lepers are transformed
into wild animals.</p>

<p>I once heard how a poor sufferer was otherwise
dealt with. He had been ill for years with an ulcer
on one of his legs. The sore had been neglected
at first and then it got too bad for treatment. But
as native doctors cannot cut off limbs as white doctors
can, the poor fellow could now do nothing but lie
about his village, and depend on his friends to help
him. As he got worse and worse, and less able to
help himself, his friends became fewer and fewer.
At last he became such a source of trouble to the
people that the men decided to put an end to it.
Accordingly they went up the hillside near and dug
a grave with a small niche to one side at the bottom.
Then they returned to the village and carried off
the helpless sufferer. He guessed at their intention
and piteously implored them to desist. &#8220;Where are
you going with me?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do not leave me
alone on the cold hillside.&#8221; But they were deaf to
his appeals. When they reached the grave they
quickly lowered the miserable wretch down, placed
him in the niche at the side, shut him in with a mat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
drove in a few stakes, filled up the grave, and left
him.</p>

<p>Not long ago I passed through a village where
some years ago I had made the acquaintance of the
head man. He was then a hale and hearty old fellow,
fond of his joke and his snuff-box. But now what
a change. I found his people mostly gone and he
himself but the wreck of what he had been. Everything
round about had a neglected look. Some
disease or other had laid him low and friends had
gone. I found him sitting on a mat close to a fire.
His poor skeleton legs were firmly bound at knees
and ankles with cords made of bark. He had tried
many doctors, he said, and had paid for much medicine,
and now he had nothing to do but sit and wait
for the end. He was too old to visit a white doctor;
he was accustomed to the medicine of his own people
and would not try that of strangers.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of suffering in African villages
silently and patiently borne; and the white doctor
can do a great deal to alleviate it. I can assure you
children that your pennies put into the missionary
box to help to support hospitals in heathen lands
are not given in vain; and there is no part of
missionary work that more deserves your help.
Remember what our Lord said, &#8220;Inasmuch as
ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my
brethren, ye have done it unto Me.&#8221;</p>

<small>MAGIC MEDICINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the previous chapter we were talking about
doctors and medicine. In this chapter we shall hear
more about medicine, but of another kind. Medicine
in Africa is of two kinds&mdash;one for the lawful purpose
of healing the sick, the other for the unlawful purpose
of bewitching people and doing other dark deeds.
It is when we begin to look into all that surrounds
this unlawful medicine that we meet &#8220;the heathen
in his darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black people firmly believe in the power of
medicines to bewitch, to enable the possessor to
steal or to do some other thing equally bad. Anything
that happens for which they cannot account,
they ascribe to witchcraft medicine. The white
people are supposed to be the possessors of great
stores of such medicine, and from that to obtain their
power. This belief crops up on all sides in their
daily life, for there are unlawful medicines for almost
everything. All one requires to know is where to
find a dealer in such medicine, and he will make it
to your order, no matter what you may want it for.
He will give you medicine to bury against your enemy
that he may die, or he will make you medicine that
will enable you to kill game easily. Everything
can be done by the power of medicine.</p>

<p>The darkest part of this belief in medicines is that
in which certain people are supposed to possess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
power to cause the death of others that they may
feast upon their dead bodies. Such horrible people
are called &#8220;Afiti&#8221; in this part of Africa. They
are supposed through their medicine to have powers
of making themselves invisible at will, of going great
distances in the smallest interval of time, of changing
themselves into beasts, etc. These &#8220;Afiti&#8221; are
supposed to gather during the night round the
grave of any recently buried person to call the
dead man out and to feast upon him. The bark
of a fox or the hoot of an owl at night is said to be
the signal call for these wretches to assemble for
their awful meal.</p>

<p>When a mysterious death has happened in a village
it is at once blamed upon one of the &#8220;Afiti.&#8221; But
who he is nobody can tell. It may be one&#8217;s very
own father, for the &#8220;Afiti&#8221; during the day retain
their ordinary form, one never can tell. Great fear
hangs over the village for each suspects his neighbour
of being the cause of the death. Then the witch-finder
is sent for. He, or she&mdash;for sometimes the
witch-finder is a woman&mdash;comes laden with medicines
and charms and stays in the village. No one now
will be seen out of doors after dark in case of being
suspected. After learning all the gossip of the village
and finding out who was on bad terms with the dead
man, the witch-finder proceeds to business.</p>

<p>The people are assembled to the sound of a large
drum and stand in a circle in fear and trembling.
The witch-finder now begins to dance and spin round
and work himself up to a high pitch of excitement,
during which he rushes here and there among the
frightened people, smells their hands for traces of blood,
and finally calls out the name of the guilty person.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>Then the poison ordeal is tried. A poison draught
is made up with bark from a certain tree and the
accused is given it to drink. Should he happen to
vomit it up again after having taken it, he is declared
to be innocent, and payment is made to him. But
should he happen to die, what further proof was
necessary? The village is now clear of the evil one,
and great rejoicings are made and payment given to
the witch-finder. In this way hundreds and thousands
of innocent people have met their end in Darkest
Africa.</p>

<p>This belief in &#8220;Afiti&#8221; is one of the most difficult
to deal with which the missionary encounters. You
try to explain that God never gave people such power
over one another, but although agreeing with you
outwardly, they secretly cling to the old belief and
their faith in the poison cup, for there are among them
people foolish enough to imagine themselves possessed
of &#8220;Afiti&#8221; powers who actually open graves and
steal bits, especially fingers, from the dead. It is
the occurrence of such cases that causes the people
to cling to their belief.</p>

<p>Among the negro peoples the makers of medicine
are supposed to have power over the spirits and to
&#8220;bind&#8221; them into what are called &#8220;fetiches.&#8221; A
fetich may consist of any convenient-sized object.
It may be a small horn or a snail&#8217;s shell or a stone.
But it has power only when the witch-doctor has
imprisoned a spirit in it. This he does of course for
payment. And fetiches are made to meet every
wish of the human heart. You can obtain them
to make you brave, or wise, or cunning, or to prevail
over your enemy, or to prevent theft, or to be successful
in the chase or anything you wish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>In this part of Africa when a lion begins to prey
upon human beings, he is supposed to be one of the
&#8220;Afiti&#8221; who, to satisfy his craving for human flesh,
has transformed himself into a lion for the time being.
At a certain village on the river Shir&eacute; several people
had been taken by a large crocodile which was well
known because of its boldness. This animal was
believed not to be a real crocodile by the people of
the village, but to be one of the &#8220;Afiti&#8221; transformed.
After the brute had taken off several people, one
of the men of the village determined to put an end
to the tragedies. Seizing a spear he boldly went
into the water to try conclusions with the monster.
But he too in spite of his medicine was taken off and
only a reddish tinge on the water marked the spot
where he had been seized and dragged down.</p>

<p>Quite recently I asked a boy to go an errand for
me. His destination was about fifteen miles away
and he could not possibly arrive before dark. But
the road was perfectly safe or I would not have asked
him to go. At first he did not want to go, declaring
he was sure &#8220;Afiti&#8221; would catch him whenever it
became dark. If a fire is seen in the distance where
no fire should be, it is at once put down to the presence
of the dreaded corpse eaters. I remember another
boy who not long ago insisted in maintaining that one
night an &#8220;Mfiti&#8221; had come and sat on his chest for
a long time, while he remained in mortal terror lest
it should begin to tear him. Explanations of nightmare
were of no avail. The boy firmly believes to
this day that he had a narrow escape from being
devoured.</p>

<p>Some years ago I remember seeing a medicine
man surrounded by a crowd of natives. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
telling them that he had medicine to protect him
from being hit by any stone that might be thrown
at him. His word was just accepted and no native
ever thought of lifting a stone to try. When a white
man offered to have a throw at him, he objected,
saying that his medicine had power over black people
only. Another man, I can recall, produced a horn
containing a very powerful medicine that enabled
the possessor to enter unseen into any house by
simply stepping through the wall. He was asked
to display its powers on the white man&#8217;s house. He
also declined saying that his medicine was made
against black men&#8217;s houses only, which are made of
grass, and not against white men&#8217;s, that are built
of brick.</p>

<p>What a magnificent faith these poor black people
have in their magic medicine! If it fails, it fails
only because someone is working against them with
more powerful medicine still, and a new supply must
be got. The belief in the medicine remains as strong
as ever. If this unwavering faith could only be
transformed in a single day to Him who is the Light
of the World, what a change would come over the
Dark Continent.</p>

<small>THE DANCE AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I am sure you have learned a great deal about
the African people and their children, yet there are
two important things I have not written about,
and these are their dances and their musical instruments.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
I had intended to put this part into the
chapter on games, but I thought I had better not,
although the dance is considered a game by the
African children. In the hot season when the moon
is full, the whole country side resounds with the beating
of drums, and the shrill voices of the dancers are
borne far on the warm night wind. There are many
kinds of drums from the deep bass to the high tenor.
They are beaten with the hands and on a still night
the deep boom of the bass drum can be heard for
miles interrupted by the short snap of the smaller
ones. The time seems at first very irregular, and
for a white man difficult to follow. But the dancers
move out and in and round about, and keep up the
game till sunrise. Unfortunately the dances are
not all harmless ones, and the less said about some of
them the better.</p>

<p>Of musical instruments the African children have
quite a large number. One of their favourites
is called a &#8220;Sese.&#8221; I can best describe it to you
by calling it an African mandoline. The body is
made out of a large dry gourd and the strings are
made by twisting threads together till the desired
thickness and strength is obtained. The left hand
fingers are used for pressing down the strings which
are &#8220;tweeked&#8221; by the fingers of the right hand.
The music is very pleasing when the &#8220;Sese&#8221; player
is a short distance off. The tunes are quite unlike
anything white children hear at home, and charm
one by their quaintness. I have tried to play the
instrument, but of course failed. The boys themselves
are not all able to play the &#8220;Sese.&#8221; Only
those who are musical can, and after much patient
practice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>Another instrument with which the boys amuse
themselves is called the &#8220;Sansi.&#8221; It is the African
piano, and is played a great deal by river boys. The
sounding board in the &#8220;Sansi&#8221; is made out of a
flat piece of wood about six or seven inches square
and about an inch deep, hollowed out. Two rows
of little keys are fixed along this board. The keys
are sometimes made of wood but in good instruments
are of iron. These keys are all different sizes, and are
arranged so as to produce a kind of a scale, pleasing
to the African ear and not unpleasant to us. The
instrument is grasped in both hands and the keys
are skilfully played by the thumbs and forefingers
of both hands. Sometimes these instruments are
bedecked with beads and pieces of shells which cause
a sort of buzzing accompaniment to the music. A
good deal of skill is necessary to play the &#8220;Sansi&#8221;
properly, and it is only a boy here and there who can
do it well. Like the &#8220;Sese,&#8221; the &#8220;Sansi&#8221; sounds
more pleasant when a bit away.</p>

<p>The flute is another source of amusement to the
African boy. He makes his own instrument out of
a piece of reed, but he can appreciate a good tin whistle
from across the sea. From the reed he takes the pith
and bores three or four holes in the hollow tube, and
his flute is ready. The notes produced from the native
flute always seem to me to be of a weird melancholy
nature. The same three or four notes are blown
over and over again, and become in time rather
monotonous to the white man.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">DRILL REPLACES THE DANCE</p>

<p>Then there is the African violin called the &#8220;mgoli.&#8221;
It consists of a drum through which sticks are passed.
There is one string drawn tight over a bridge which
stands in the drum. This primitive fiddle is played<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
with a bow. It is not so difficult to play as the
others already described, but its music is much more
monotonous.</p>

<p>The African boys are also expert at playing on a
wooden dulcimer which they call &#8220;Nangolingondo.&#8221;
Pieces of hard wood tuned to the African scale are
laid across two pieces of palm stem and are fixed in
their places by pegs. Then two players squat down
on opposite sides of the dulcimer armed with a stick
in each hand. One player leads off with a few
flourishes and is joined by the other player whose
notes overlap and yet fit into and between those of
the first player&#8217;s in a marvellous manner. The music
is fast and furious, but cannot be kept up for a long
stretch at a time. As with the other instruments,
this one is heard to advantage some distance off.</p>

<p>The buzzing of a certain kind of beetle is also made
to do duty with children as a kind of toy instrument.
The unfortunate beetle is caught and fixed up with
grass so that he cannot get away, although his wings
are free to buzz with as much as he likes. In order
to make this beetle-music the insect is held by the
grass in front of the opened mouth. According as
the mouth is opened so does the buzzing sound vary.</p>

<p>There are many other kinds of African musical
instruments, mostly of a very simple kind, giving
forth but a note or two peculiar to the African and
beloved by him. The children are on the whole not
unmusical and can be trailed to sing very sweetly
indeed. But I am sure they like their own songs
best.</p>

<small>HINDRANCES TO THE GOSPEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I think I had better not write much more about
Africa and its children lest I tire you. There are
many other interesting things one would like to tell
you but I am afraid this book is already quite long
enough. In India and in China and in other lands
I am sure it is harder than it is in Africa to win the
people for Christ. Yet there are many hindrances
too in the black man&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>If all Africa is to be Christ&#8217;s, then Mohammedanism
in the north must be overcome, and must be prevented
from creeping down southwards. It is already
well over the equator, especially on the east coast,
and, if left unhindered, will spread right onwards.
But the Church of Christ at home must see that this
does not happen, and Christians must put forth
all their strength in the cause of their Lord and Master.
And you children too have your part to play, a part
which is told you in this little hymn of which I have
copied two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;The fields are all white</div>
<div class="indent">And the reapers are few;</div>
<div class="verse">We children are willing,</div>
<div class="indent">But what can we do</div>
<div class="verse">To work for our Lord in His Harvest?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;We&#8217;ll work by our prayers,</div>
<div class="indent">By the offerings we bring,</div>
<div class="verse">By small self-denials;</div>
<div class="indent">The least little thing</div>
<div class="verse">May work for our Lord in His Harvest.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>Another enemy of Christ in Africa is the native&#8217;s
belief in the customs and superstitions of their forefathers.
The old people cling to these, and tell the
children that the Gospel is only white men&#8217;s stories.
They die hard these old superstitions, but they are
slowly and surely disappearing before the light of
God&#8217;s message. To obey Christ means that a great
deal of the old life must be given up and put away
altogether; and it is here that the struggle begins.
Temptations to drift back into the old way of living
beset the African Christian on all sides. They come
from without and from within, and only the word of
God planted in his heart can keep him from falling.</p>

<p>Polygamy is one of the great obstacles in his path.
I wonder if you know what that big word means.
In words it means that the men may marry many
wives, but in reality it means that the women and
children are living in conditions that give them
but little chance of rising out of the darkness by
which they are surrounded. I remember how much
surprised I was when told that a certain little girl,
who had been at a village school but who was now
withdrawn, was married. She was not really married
of course, only &#8220;bespoken&#8221; as it were, by a big
bearded man, who already had more than one wife.
The girl had therefore been taken from school and
was lost to Mission influence. In Africa the girls
have but little of the happy girlhood known in England,
for they step from childhood right into womanhood.</p>

<p>There is another enemy of Christ in Africa that I
do not care to write to you about, because it comes
from our own race, but it would not be fair to make
no mention of it whatever. The force of example
goes a long long way in Africa, and often does a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
deal more than words. It is what you <i>do</i> rather than
what you <i>say</i> that first attracts the heathen. Now
if a careless white man forgets this and like the
prodigal son in the far-off country gives himself up
to the evil ways of living, he is doing a great deal
of harm to Christ&#8217;s Kingdom in Africa, and is putting
a serious stumbling block in the way of the poor
black people. If such white men would but remember
that they come from a Christian land and behave
towards their ignorant black neighbours as Christian
gentlemen this enemy of the Gospel would soon be
laid low.</p>

<p>Let me now tell you a little how missionary work
among the heathen Africans is carried on. In different
missions the work is carried on in different ways, but
the end is always the same&mdash;that the Gospel be
preached to the heathen.</p>

<p>Many of the missions divide their work into four
parts. One is called Evangelistic&mdash;that is the part
of the work in which the Gospel is preached to the
people. Another is called Medical because doctors
and nurses join in the mission work to heal the sick
and help the helpless. Another part is Educational&mdash;the
teaching of the people in school, so that they may
be able to read the Word of God. The last part is
called Industrial, for in it the African Christians
are taught trades to show them that work is not for
slaves only, and to make them useful members of the
community.</p>

<p>Of course in every mission you may not find all
those four departments of work. Some missions
are mainly Evangelistic, others Industrial, but in
all large missions in Africa you generally find the
four. In the evangelistic work the missionary, fresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
from home, is at a great disadvantage till he has
mastered the native language. Then this difficulty
over, he finds the way open to the black man&#8217;s heart.
Experience however is showing us more and more that
it is not the white man who will evangelise Africa,
but the African, and the work of the white missionary
is more and more being reduced to the training of
the native evangelists who will carry the message
of love to the people.</p>

<p>Hospital, School, and Industrial work have, in Africa,
been practically forced upon the missionaries. The
native of Africa sick is most helpless, and the native
of Africa well is most indifferent to sickness in others.
Hence the constant ministration to his own sick
folks by white doctors and nurses fills him with
astonishment, and causes him to think why this
should be done. It is a magnificent object lesson
to the native of the practice in our lives of the Gospel
of Christ.</p>

<p>One of the best gifts that can be given to any race
of people is the gift of the Bible in their own tongue.
But to prevent the Bible being a sealed book to them,
the people must first be taught how to read. So the
missionary must turn school-master and teach his
people their letters. Here, then, is the beginning of
educational work and it is found a great help to the
evangelistic. For in school, reading is not the only
subject taught. The children learn, as they never
otherwise could, the story of Jesus. And the teacher
is naturally the evangelist. So preaching and teaching
in Africa go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Then there is work such as the African is not
accustomed to. He is by no means lazy, as is so often
said by ill-informed people; but he has to be taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
that work is not for inferiors only. Hence all kinds
of useful trades are taught in large missions. The
Africans make very good carpenters, gardeners,
bricklayers, and printers. In fact, they pick up
readily such trades as are taught them. Of course,
at their present stage of development, they cannot
be compared with white workman, and should never
so be compared, but they do exceedingly well so far
as they are able.</p>

<p>In thus educating and training their people the
missions are endeavouring to make their converts
Christians, who can read their Bibles, and who will
prove themselves to be useful and industrious members
of the community in which they live.</p>

<small>METHODS OF MISSION WORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter, which must be the last, I want to let
you see as well as possible a little mission work in
the various departments you read about in the preceding
chapter. Let me begin with the evangelistic.
In a missionary magazine I have come across a description
which will suit the purpose very well. Here
it is, a visit to a village preaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our machila carriers are impatient to be off.
They are not always so anxious about an early start,
but to-day we can sympathise with their impatience,
for the hot weather is upon us, and travelling during
the heat of the day is anything but comfortable.
A start is made at last, and we are now as eager as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
our &#8216;boys&#8217; to see the end of the seven or eight-mile
journey. It will take us almost two hours to
do this short distance&mdash;two hours of as unpleasant
travelling as one could wish to be saved from, for
machila travelling is at the best but a mild form
of being tossed in a blanket.</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriers keep up an incessant chatter all the
way, varied at times with a break into the chorus of
one of their machila songs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;Gurr-r-r, Mwana wa mkango, Ine</div>
<div class="indent">Child of a lion, I am fierce</div>
<div class="indent">Fierce am I, child of a lion.</div>
<div class="verse">Gurr-r-r, Gurr-r-r.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Such is the complaint of one of the carriers as he
sweats at the machila pole. He imitates, with wonderful
skill, the deep growl of the lion, and fondly compares
himself for strength to the king of beasts. The
other boys with lusty chorus give him every support
in his contention, and even we agree, judging from
his deep growls, that he must really be what he says
he is, and soon the chorus ends.</p>

<p>&#8220;But here we are at Chentambo&#8217;s village. Our
machila men promptly retire under the shade of the
nearest tree and stretch themselves out to rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The service has already begun, and, if we want to
be in time next Sunday, we must leave very early.
Che Bernard is giving an address, the gist of which is
the contrast between the old heathen life of superstition
and darkness and the new way of the cross,
of truth and light and life eternal, of the love of God
for fallen mankind, and the great sacrifice of Christ
Jesus, our Saviour.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is skilfully placed before the audience, much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
better than could be done by a white man. The
people are interested; they understand, and they
<span class="allsmcap">KNOW</span> that Bernard&#8217;s way is the right one. You
can read it on their faces. Old customs and superstitions,
however, die hard, and to-morrow, perhaps,
even to-day many of those eager listeners will be
the same careless indifferent lot they were yesterday.
But the seed is not falling only in stony places;
customs and superstitions cannot always choke it.
By and by will come the harvest and the triumph
of the Word.</p>

<p>&#8220;While Bernard is speaking let us look around.
That we are in the school is evident, for there is the
blackboard and there the easel. Over on the other
side hangs a syllable card. But on Sunday, it is
the &#8216;Nyumba ya Mulungu&#8217; (House of God), and
here we are surrounded by such a crowd as never
enters school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men, women, and children of all ages are sitting
upon the poles which do duty for seats. But when
we run our eyes over the crowd we find that the
majority are women and children. Of grown men
there are few. Where may they be? They may,
perhaps, be out of the district, on plantations, at
the railway, or down to the river for loads, but they
may also be somewhere not so far away, beer-drinking.
There is, however, quite a goodly number of youths
among our hearers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The audience is happy, noisily so. There is no such
quiet here as is given to a home preacher. The
little fat, brown, shining babies will not be still;
they insist upon making themselves heard all through
the address, and it is only when one has become
most outrageous in his conduct, that his mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
thinks it necessary to let him see the trees outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when the white man gets up to begin to speak,
all these tiny brown mortals seem by instinct to plot
against him. No doubt his white face is the cause
of it, for he is always greeted as only black babies
can welcome a white speaker. Bernard however goes
calmly on. He is used to this kind of thing and he
does not suffer from nerves. So, too with his audience,
not a word is lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crash! down goes a seat broken in two by the
weight of some half-dozen ponderous dames. But
this is quietly ignored by the rest of the audience,
and the heavy ones proceed to accommodate themselves
to a seat on the floor, as if nothing out of the
way had happened. Then two dogs have disagreed
and become unpleasant to one another, till a few
vigorous cuffs and a blow from a stick convince
our canine friends that to-day they must be on their
best behaviour, fit and proper for dogs admitted
to such an assembly. But the babies have their
own way and perform an involuntary accompaniment
all the time of the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernard has finished now. He has urged the
people to come to a decision to-day, not to put off
till the to-morrow which never comes. Now is the
time to take a stand on the side of truth and
righteousness. Who will take his stand now?
And so he leaves his audience to answer his final
appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hymn, one of the few which the school children
have learned, has been given out by Bernard. He
reads the first verse:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2a">&#8216;Mwamva mau a Mulungu</div>
<div class="indent4">Mukabvomeranji ko?</div>
<div class="indent3">Kodi musandula mtima</div>
<div class="indent4">Ndi kumvera Yesu&#8217;yo.</div>
<div class="verse">Bvomerani, Bvomerani, Bvomerani msanga tu.&#8217;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2a">&#8216;You have heard the call of Jesus</div>
<div class="indent4">And your answer now must give.</div>
<div class="indent3">Turn to Him your heart so precious,</div>
<div class="indent4">And obeying learn to live.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh believe Him: Oh believe Him: Oh believe Him: quickly do.&#8217;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;The singing is robust; there is no absence of sound,
and the hymn is enjoyed by all. It may not be the
finest of music, but it is living, real, earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then follows a short prayer and the service is over.
In a few minutes men, women, babies, and dogs
are out into the sunshine, and we are enjoying, nay,
gulping down the fresh air.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hearers&#8217; class has now assembled, and we
endeavour to teach a few of the great truths of our
faith to this little company of young men and women.
To this little class we look for the things of the future.
Here at least the ground is not stony. The seed is
being sown in good soil and by God&#8217;s blessing will
bear fruit in the future and become the foundation
on which to build another church.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the lesson is over we have a few minutes
talk with Bernard and some of the boys, to give and
to receive words of encouragement in the work.
Then once more to our machila and back home, our
&#8216;Mwana wa mkango&#8217; being as fierce as ever.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A MISSION SCHOOL CLASS</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>Now let me send you along with a mission lady
to visit a village school, so that you may know a little
about the educational work of an African mission.
But I am afraid you cannot go to the village so I
must let the lady tell of her visit herself. This is
what she writes, and had you gone with her you
would have seen it all with your own eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our Donna is coming! Our Donna is coming!&#8217;
Thus heralded, we approach the village, a flock of
small boys, who have come to meet us, dancing along
before the machila, shrieking at the pitch of their
shrill young voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our Donna has come!&#8217; announces that we have
reached the village courtyard. There stands the
school, a little grass shed, with forms like bird perches;
and the teacher, conspicuous by his clean white clothes,
and Kungauma, the headman, are waiting there to
welcome me.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a little, a wheezy horn is blown by a stalwart
young man, and the scholars begin to assemble.
Meantime I pay a visit to the women&#8217;s quarters
where the older women are busy pounding the maize
and sifting the flour. After a few words of friendly
greeting, enquires about their work and notice of their
babies&mdash;for a black mother, as well as a white one,
likes to see &#8216;her bairns respeckit like the lave&#8217;&mdash;I
return to the school. It is full to overflowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hymn is sung and prayers are said by the
teacher; then the classes arrange themselves on their
respective &#8216;perches.&#8217; I begin to examine Class 1, while
an admiring circle of fond mothers and sympathising
friends squats outside. After going conscientiously
through the lessons of Class 1, we go on to Class 2,
and I hear them their allotted task.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>&#8220;But time is flying! I ask what other classes still
remain to be examined. &#8216;Class 3 and an Infant,&#8217;
replies the teacher, indicating their whereabouts.
I glance at the dozen or so of eager little faces that
compose Class 3 and then look towards the &#8216;Infant.&#8217;
He may be such, legally so-called, but to my astonishment
I see the stalwart young man who performed
upon the bronchitic horn! It turns out later that
he is the most advanced pupil in the school and is
reading an English book, called the &#8216;Infant Reader&#8217;;
hence his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving him and Class 3 for another day, I call
the young women and girls to begin sewing. Forty
are in my class, and more would like to enter, but I
cannot give proper attention to a larger number.
One is advanced to enough sew a child&#8217;s frock, several
are hemming sashes, most of them are at the elementary
&#8216;patch&#8217; stage. As I give out the seams
I glance at their hands. Some, conscious of cleanliness
and virtue, will voluntarily turn up their little pink
palms for my inspection. &#8216;Mine are clean, Adonna,
look at mine!&#8217; while others have to be sent to
wash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon the class is hard at work. Some learn very
quickly, others find the management of the needle
almost beyond their powers; some need words of
praise and encouragement to help them to persevere,
while others require judicious fault-finding and criticism
to nip incipient vanity in the bud. A few words
about the use of the words &#8216;Please&#8217; and &#8216;Thank
you,&#8217; a few lessons in the elements of gentle bearing
to each other&mdash;courtesy to my self is never lacking&mdash;are
taken in very good part, and remembered and
put into practice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>&#8220;In the course of the day&#8217;s lesson, which lasts two
and a half to three hours, several may get advanced
from the &#8216;patch&#8217; to the &#8216;sash&#8217; stage. The price
of the ordinary sash is sixpence. (The work done in
all the sewing classes is sold later at a little bazaar,
and the proceeds are given to some scheme in connection
with the native church.) I hear the girls
planning how they will manage to buy the sash when
it is hemmed. &#8216;I have fowls at home worth sixpence,&#8217;
says one. &#8216;I have only one fowl but it
can lay eggs,&#8217; says another. Some, having no
source of income can but regretfully admire, and
envy their more fortunate companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;About two o&#8217;clock I take in the work again, and
proceed to do a little simple surgery, the binding
up of ulcers chiefly. Anything serious I decline to
dress, advising the sufferers to come to Hospital,
but the simple sores, which are sadly common, are
quite within my powers. It brings me into touch
with the people at another point of contact and
increases our sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dressings done and the farewells said, I call
my carriers, get into my machila, and off we go,
my men singing lustily as they bear me swiftly along
the native path. The village lies close among the
hills, and the path winds in and out through native
gardens and bush and long grass, while two streams
and a bog have to be forded. On either side rise
the &#8216;everlasting hills&#8217;; solemn, grand, restful,
beautiful at all times, in sunshine or shadow. In
about an hour we leave the native path and turn
into the dusty high road, and a very short time finds
us again at the mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now to show you mission hospital work. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
have found in the same magazine the story of Gwebede,
the Angoni labourer.</p>

<p>&#8220;His home was in far Angoniland&mdash;the village
where his childhood had passed, where he played
through many a sunny day, rolling in the sand till
he was white, fighting mock battles with big grasses
for spears, &#8216;tying&#8217; little houses of grass and sticks,
and lurking in them&mdash;all play and no school; and
at night time sleeping in his mother&#8217;s hut, close to
the fire, beside the dogs and the chickens. Now he
is a little boy, perhaps ten years old, and when his
brothers and uncles and companions are getting
ready to go off to work with the white men, Gwebede
joins the party. He will work for three months and
then come proudly home with his earnings. His
earnings will be an altogether unimaginable extent
of beautiful white calico. Perhaps it will be enough
to pay his mother&#8217;s hut tax, and when that is paid
they will tuck the yellow-edged paper with the stamp
on it safely away among the shiny black grass on the
inside of the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he trots gaily along the narrow path, carrying
on a stick over his shoulder some yellow cobs of
maize for food by the way. At night he is very
tired, and after roasting his corn and grinding it
up with his little white grinders he very soon drops
asleep. The party travel for a day or two, and then
stop to work for a day at some village to earn food
for the further journey. In about a week they reach
their destination and see the coffee planters&#8217; broad
acres of cleared ground where in rows grow the coffee
plants, as big as gooseberry bushes, some of them
a little bigger. Then is Gwebede installed with
hoe in hand amongst the coffee.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ATTACKED BY A LEOPARD</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>&#8220;Now one morning early Gwebede got up and had
just stepped out of the grass shelter where he slept,
when a great leopard sprang on him, caught him by
the back of the neck in its mouth, and bounded off
with him as easily as a cat would do with a mouse.
Gwebede&#8217;s brothers are waked from their sleep,
and look out. &#8216;A leopard!&#8217; they shout as they
seize hold of the red brands of their evening fire and
rush out yelling as they run. Into the grass they
dash: yonder is the leopard: after him! He is
frightened: he drops the boy: he is off!</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they carefully pick up Gwebede. Poor
little Gwebede! Is he dead? No, but there is a
great wound as if the leopard had taken a mouthful
away from the back of his head. They take him to
their master, who promptly binds up the wound,
and sends them off with a letter to the hospital.
It is a long distance, and it is late in the afternoon
when they reach the mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was the first we saw of Gwebede. There did
not seem to be much hope for him. A little thin
boy with a face full of terror, whom the slightest
movement made to cry out with pain. He refused
to swallow medicine, so we injected under his skin
a little dose of that blessed drug that takes away pain,
and in a few minutes he was asleep. Then we washed
and dressed his wound. A leopard&#8217;s teeth are such
dirty things that the wound they make is very
difficult to get clean. One has to wash and wash
and wash for a long time, going carefully into all the
holes and comers.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the days passed the pain became less, and the
wound began to heal. For several days Gwebede
cried a good deal, and we had to repeat the dose under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
his skin to put him to sleep. Then we noticed that
he was beginning to enjoy his food, and one day
the attendant told us that &#8216;Gwebede had laughed.&#8217;
These were good signs.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few weeks later if you could have seen Gwebede
you would have seen that he was no longer thin, but
getting quite respectably stout, and also that he was
constantly smiling. The night attendant noticed,
however, that he sometimes started and cried out in
his sleep. This is the way with people that have
been hurt by wild beasts. For long afterwards
they dream dreadful dreams. Indeed, some of them
are afraid to sleep alone. They can&#8217;t help thinking
that a beast will come into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day Gwebede&#8217;s brothers came to take him
home. They said that the whole party from their
village were about to start for home. We begged them
to leave Gwebede with us to be attended to, and we
asked them to come back for him in a month. They
said they were afraid to go back without him, because
Gwebede&#8217;s mother would say, &#8216;What have you done
with Gwebede?&#8217; We told them that Gwebede
was not well enough to do without having his wound
dressed. They saw also that he was quite happy in
the ward. So they decided to go back to their master
and do another month&#8217;s work, and at the end of the
month to come again for Gwebede.</p>

<p>&#8220;The month passed, Gwebede walked about slowly
and sedately, holding his head in the air because his
neck was stiff. He got fatter and fatter, till his
face grew like a little round moon&mdash;a black moon&mdash;full
of smiles and dimples. He was the jolliest little
boy you could imagine. Then came again the big
brothers. Gwebede&#8217;s neck was now quite healed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
The great open wound had closed up and now
there was only a scar left. Soon he was dancing
and skipping along the road with his brothers, having
clean forgotten the stiffness of his neck, and that
was the last we saw of little Gwebede.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that you have heard such a great deal about
Africa and its children, and about mission work, are
you not glad, my dear young friends, that you are
enjoying the privilege of helping to make Christ
known among the black people, that you are helping
them to learn to read and write, that you are helping
them to be taught useful trades, and that you are
helping to bind up their wounds and ease their pain?
I know that you are. We all want Africa to belong
to Christ and in God&#8217;s own time it will be so. Meantime
we must not faint or be weary although the
fight against the powers of darkness be fierce and
long. Africa, the dark continent must emerge from
darkness at the call of her Lord and Master and
take her place among the nations who live in the
Light of the Saviour of the world.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
